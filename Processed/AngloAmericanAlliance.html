</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In presenting this volume to the public it is not the
intention of the author to offer it as a literary masterpiece, but, in
his adopted language&mdash;conscious of his limitation&mdash;merely to
give expression to his thoughts on certain problems of life that have
always seemed to him of particular significance.</p>
<p>At present there appears to be a general bombastic clamor among
certain nations who, decrying others as barbarous, claim to have
reached the highest pinnacle of civilization. Yet a glance at the
existing conditions in those self-lauded governments will reveal
rampant corruption among their leaders who, for their own selfish ends,
<i>retard legislations</i> which are absolutely imperative for the
general welfare. It is not necessary to mention other ways in which the
people are being daily betrayed, for this is sufficient to render any
thinking person despondent and pessimistic.</p>
<p>The causes of the decadence of nations are not the laws which have
been enacted, but the flagrant violation of these very laws, actuated
by greed, avarice and commercialism which are generated in the
individual in power. The only remedy for this state is either a leader
of intrepid courage or the awakening <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e329" href="#xd26e329" name="xd26e329">viii</a>]</span>of the
people themselves and their demanding reforms by public mandate.</p>
<p>The true meaning of civilization is Universal Brotherhood, and in
this sense, the leading lights in every stratum of life, whether in
Government or in Commerce, in Religion or in Science, stand arraigned
and indicted before the tribunal of conscience for retarding this
laudable spirit of Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Why do not Captains of Industry and Commerce, instead of throttling
each other, by a unanimous effort, promulgate laws on a reciprocal
basis among themselves?</p>
<p>Why do not Scientists, instead of confining their efforts to
individual endeavors, combine their forces so as to enhance the chance
of accomplishing greater results in research and exploration?</p>
<p>Why do not Spiritual <span class="corr" id="xd26e339" title=
"Source: Shepards">Shepherds</span>, instead of preaching intolerance
and fanaticism, bring their flocks together in harmony? An Oriental
scholar in the Congress of Religions, at the Columbian Fair, declared
that &ldquo;the flocks are willing to pasture together, but it is the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e342" title=

apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in fine, why do not the Nations, each claiming the highest forms
of civilization, instead of disseminating national, sectional and race
hatred, form an alliance, which will advance the cause of Universal
Brotherhood, and brighten the hope of bringing enduring peace to the
world at large?</p>
<p>In this golden era, with its vast numbers of diplomats, <span class=

theologians, scientists, and its countless fraternal
organizations,&mdash;each preaching, fraternity, love and
charity,&mdash;what evil spirit or genii prevents them from forming a
union between two of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e352" href=

of Governments,&mdash;America and Britain&mdash;perfect types in their
entity, having similar laws, language and aspirations?</p>
<p>Who will be the Savior, through whose agency this happy cross
fertilization, inoculation or union shall be achieved? It was the above
thoughts, and the idea of an alliance between COLUMBIA and BRITANNIA,
that suggested in all seriousness the following frivolously allegorical
narrative,&mdash;a <i>potpourri</i> of weird fancy, satire and
imagination, a mosaic of the sublime and the ridiculous, on themes
worthy of a master.</p>
<p>Yet if some reader should find, even in this fantastic guise, an
occasional thought worthy of arousing him to nobler efforts, the author
will consider himself well rewarded.</p>
<p>In regard to his prophecies for the future, he is willing to be
called a consummate prevaricator should his desire for the betterment

lighter than he has foreseen.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Young Ladies&rsquo; Seminary</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is 1960, Anno Domini. The Earth, notwithstanding
many dire predictions of charlatans and religious fanatics, and in
spite of numerous cataclysms, conflagrations and political upheavals,
was rotating serenely on its axis.</p>
<p>The Diana Young Ladies&rsquo; Seminary, situated upon the
picturesque hills of Cornwall on the Hudson, is a few miles north of
the West Point Military Academy. The seminary buildings, having
formerly been the palatial homestead of a multi-millionaire, about half
a century previously had been bequeathed to the State of New York, with
ample endowments for its maintenance and development. It had long since
become one of the finest institutions of learning of its kind, not only
of America, but of the whole civilized world.</p>
<p>The donor of this magnificent seat of knowledge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>for
young ladies was a man of &ldquo;polarity,&rdquo; of positive and
negative action and reaction. He was in fact a typical incarnation and
embodiment of a dualism, immortalized by the fertile fancy of Robert
Louis Stevenson, in his story of &ldquo;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.&rdquo;
While on the one hand he had an apparently irresistible and
monomaniacal cunning in robbing his fellow men by monopolizing all the
necessities of life, crushing with hellish unscrupulousness all
competition in every channel of industry, and strewing his wake with
industrial wrecks,&mdash;on the other hand he busied himself with the
erection of hospitals and churches, and in endowing colleges with a
princely liberality, commensurate to his other nature.</p>
<p>Emerson, the philosopher, says &ldquo;The whole universe is so, and
so every one of its parts,&rdquo; that &ldquo;an inevitable dualism
bisects nature,&rdquo; each thing being a half and suggesting its
complement. As the mammoth Californian redwood tree, which with its
towering height looks overpoweringly stupendous when compared with the
tiny otaheite orange or dwarf Japanese plant, so was the difference in
power of acquisitiveness and possibilities of dispensation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>between
this colossus compared with ordinary mortals.</p>
<p>The real motive of his charity could not be divined; whether it was
because, pricked by a guilty conscience, he used this means as a
palliative for his sins, or whether he was entirely oblivious of
wrong-doing and was prompted only by a frank desire for doing good, was
never determined. But at any rate after his death it was found that he
had donated his palaces, with munificent endowment funds, to establish
this educational institution for females. Moreover, it is not my
intention to write a biography of this dual monster of money-maniac and
philanthropist, for his deeds are written on the graves and sorrowing
hearts of his victims, as well as in the grateful remembrance and
esteem of his beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Besides, we are told that God works good even through the agency of
the devil, and if he really had been a satellite of Satan, the great
usefulness and wide influence for good of the Seminary demonstrated the
veracity of the above statement.</p>
<p>The Diana Seminary had proven its right to its high place in the
public esteem. Its fame <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>had reached every corner of the
earth. Young women, not only from America but from every clime and
nation, flocked thither seeking to perfect themselves in such branches
of education as are the necessary requirements of the fair sex to fit
them to reign supreme in any capacity, from teaching in a country
school to presiding on regal thrones and guiding the destinies of
Nations.</p>
<p>The Diana Seminary had become particularly famous for the especial
branches of a curriculum which rendered the young ladies magnificently
lovely in form, chic in habilaments, brilliant and vivacious in
conversation, serene and dignified in carriage, sweet and optimistic in
nature, pure in sentiments, and in addition conferred upon them all the
necessary qualifications of accomplished housewives, virtues all of
which are inherent in American women and susceptible of highest
development.</p>
<p>The graduates of this Seminary were always eagerly sought in
marriage, not only by the deserving young men living near the college,
but also by the nobility and even the royalty of Europe. The demands of
the latter class were indeed so great as to alarm the fond parents
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>across the ocean for the future happiness of their
daughters, and they were thus compelled to send their beloved ones to
this Institution in order to acquire that polish which their American
sisters had proven so desirable.</p>
<p>Amongst the many English maidens who were there matriculated was
beautiful Aurora Cunningham, the only daughter of the Secretary of
Foreign affairs of Great Britain.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the beauty and charms of Aurora. It
is true that she could not be compared with the Goddesses of ancient
Greece, nor did she resemble the bewitching sylvan nymphs depicted by
the brush and pen of masters of art. She was a mortal; suffice it to
say, that she was a graceful girl of exquisitely moulded form, of
medium height, with luxuriant golden tresses, which, shimmering in the
sunlight, justified her baptismal name. Her large, dreamy blue eyes
mirrored the purity of her soul, and the dimples on her cheeks were so
deep and alluring that all who looked upon them felt their compelling
charm.</p>
<p>She was, in a word, a typical English maiden. Highly accomplished,
and though dainty in demeanor, nevertheless she was not one of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>those frail, ailing butterflies who exist and
thrive only in artificial atmosphere. Having been reared with greatest
care, by means of a complete course of calisthenics and out-of-door
sports, with all her refined mien she was a hardy and healthy specimen
of feminine beauty as well as a leader in all the strenuous pastimes of
the Diana Seminary.</p>
<p>She was called the &ldquo;sunshine&rdquo; of the Seminary, and none
other merited the appellation so well. Consequently she was idolized by
the rest of the students and was much sought after by the gallant young
men in the vicinity. After the manner of girl students who are given to
violent friendships, Aurora was devoted to her room-mate in the person
of a charming American girl named Margaret MacDonald, the daughter of a
Western Senator.</p>
<p>Margaret was entirely the opposite of Aurora,&mdash;her very
antithesis. She was somewhat taller, with sparkling black eyes and
raven hair, of imposing dignity and carriage, but withal the equal of
Aurora in the matter of natural gifts and accomplishments. She had,
moreover, a captivating frivolity and aggressiveness which almost
bordered on masculinity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps it was this complete diversity of temperament and of type
that engendered an intense affinity between the girls. For although
diametrically differing even in their exposition of ideas, they were
drawn to each other with a mysterious sympathy which attracted the
attention of outsiders and furnished ample excuse for comment. Directly
after their first meeting they had become inseparable companions and
confidants.</p>
<p>As the time passed this strange attachment grew so marked and its
manifestations so alarmingly flagrant that they themselves became aware
of its dangerous consequences. They realized that if they gave free
license to indiscreet emotional demonstrations in the class room or in
public, not only would their actions not be tolerated by the College
faculty and cause their expulsion from the Seminary, but they would
also be subjected to unendurable ostracism by the rest of the students.
But still worse was the confronting fact that they would undoubtedly
become the topic of unpleasant notoriety through the publicity given by
the sensational press. They had therefore the good judgment to pledge
themselves to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>control their emotions in the presence of the
class, and to exercise wide-awake circumspection in their behavior in
public and towards the opposite sex.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that by the happy faculty of diplomacy,
inherent in them, they succeeded with consummate delicacy and skill in
maintaining their natural poise and normal attitude throughout the
seminary course.</p>
<p>Like the magnetic pole the Diana Seminary had become the center of
attraction for the adjacent youths, especially the Academy boys, who on
all gala occasions were welcome guests at the Seminary.</p>
<p>The experiment of co-education had long since been proven a failure.
By the well known law of electricity, that bodies similarly electrified
repel each other, and bodies oppositely electrified attract, it seems
that the constant familiarity and co-mingling of the two sexes in
co-educational institutions at the romantic age of puberty had a
somewhat similar effect and breeded contempt, blunting that keen
fondness for each other which seems natural, and so was not surprising
that in such institutions both sexes, when leaving college, separated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>more like enemies than friends and lovers.</p>
<p>The isolation of the sexes naturally created an intensity of
affection and a desire for association, and when the two periodically
came in contact caused that rapturous thrill of hearts and nascent
unification of souls. This undoubtedly was the plausible explanation,
at least one of the reasons, why the Seminary girls were always in
demand and were participants of so many happy unions.</p>
<p>The only exception to the rule were Aurora and Margaret who,
although in every way agreeable to the aspirants for their hearts and
hands, refrained from making an alliance throughout their college
course. It was piteously amusing, however, to see those gallant swains
from the Academy heading for the Seminary whenever opportunity
presented. Their hearts were filled with intense ardor and their lips
and pubescent moustaches were pregnant with the microbes of
Eros,&mdash;in a high state of fermentation&mdash;blurting out with
tense anxiety the momentous query, &ldquo;Wilt thou be mine?&rdquo; to
Aurora or Margaret, only to return vanquished by the cold decisive
negative. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was no cause for ennui at the Diana Seminary.
Notwithstanding the serious course of study, there was ample jollity.
The tedium of their leisure hours was beguiled with all kinds of
recreations according to the seasons of the year.</p>
<div class="figure p020width"><img src="images/p020.jpg" alt=
"A &ldquo;Full-Back&rdquo; in 1960" width="335" height="508">
<p class="figureHead">A &ldquo;Full-Back&rdquo; in 1960</p>
</div>
<p>There were the various Seminary teams in basket ball, fencing,
golfing, calisthenics and amateur theatricals. The girls also indulged
in excursions to the exhibitions of the Academy boys, on their gala
days of mimic warfare in the campus, as well as to their contests on
the diamond or gridiron at foot ball. This latter sport having reached
in those days the top notch of perfection, it furnished the fair
spectators thrills of excitement when the contestants in their improved
steel helmets and cuirass, with pronged leggings and spiked shoes
looked like veritable knights of the chivalric ages. It <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>gave an
additional source of lingering pleasure and admiration at such contests
when half a dozen ambulances were required to cart away the gladiators
in <i lang="fr">hors du combat</i>.</p>
<p>Besides all the above recreations, the Seminary girls had also their
various secret organizations which furnished ample work for winter
months. One of the most notable of these fraternities was called the D.
N. A., signifying &ldquo;Daughters of the New Alliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brief description of the sacred rites of this unique fraternity,
on an interesting initiation, may not here be amiss. It took place
during the incumbency of the two principal organizers and charter
members&mdash;Aurora and Margaret,&mdash;the latter occupying at the
time the most exalted position of Reverend High Priestess and the
former that of Supreme Guide. The initiation in question was remarkable
for the singular coincidence that the applicants for membership were
discovered to be of half a dozen nationalities&mdash;French, German,
Scotch, Irish, Italian and Hebrew,&mdash;and this unusual circumstance
lent the occasion widespread sensation among the other members and made
the session most memorable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>A peep in the temple revealed a bewildering spectacle, an
&ldquo;Adamless Eden&rdquo; of loveliness as it were. Margaret
MacDonald, enveloped in gorgeously embroidered Grecian robes, enthroned
on an elevated dais, a golden sceptre in hand, and a brilliant diadem
on her shapely head, presented an imposing figure as High Priestess,
while Aurora in a tight fitting cuirass of variegated spangles, holding
a trident, performed her official duties. Other functionaries attired
in chaste Grecian costumes occupied their respective positions.</p>
<p>In the proscenium the applicants, attired in their respective
national costumes, followed the assistant guide to the gate of the
temple when, on pressing a button, an extremely melodious chant surged
through the atmosphere. This called the attention of the Supreme Guide
to the fact that there were applicants for membership. The Supreme
Guide in the same manner then made the announcement to the high
priestess, and the latter commanded them to be admitted to the temple.
At the clanking of the cymbals and the sounding of the fanfares as if
by magic the gate was ajar, revealing to the eyes of the new disciples
a dazzling scene of harmoniously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>blended loveliness. They filed
in and arranged themselves in the shape of a crescent at the lower end
of the temple.</p>
<p>In the centre of the room, on an alabaster table, they could discern
a glass receptacle in which, squirming and wriggling, were a quantity
of angle worms; on another similar table close by they could see a
golden cage, wherein half a dozen tiny rodents were playing tag. In one
corner a fierce, pugnacious billy-goat was butting with vicious vigor
against one of the Grecian columns of the temple.</p>
<p>When the sound of the fanfares subsided the High Priestess, rising
suddenly and striking three times on the marble floor with her magic
sceptre, commanded silence, and in a sweet voice spoke thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supreme Guide of the order of D. N. A. what bringest thou to
this sanctuary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide answered in pathetic tones: &ldquo;Thou High Priestess of
the order of D. N. A., I bring thee greeting. I bring thee also jewels
rare, for thy shrine; gems, not still life or crystals petrified, but
forms divine, animate with heaving breasts, with radiant brows, and
sparkling eyes that volumes speak, that even Cupid, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>dazed,
would soon forget his ancient Psyche fair, and yet unable be whom
amongst these for himself to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they signified their willingness to be tested for
courage and fortitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they ready to travel through the tortuous path of the
inquisition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then prithee, take them to the ante-chamber that their eyes
may be blindfolded and the robes of chastity may be thrown over them.
Then bring them thither through the tortuous path of the inquisition to
my presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly they were taken to the ante-room and while being
prepared for the journey they were given plain intimation that they
were to make a repast of the angle worms and fondly handle the young
rodents, while direct hints of riding the bellicose goat were thrown
out, as though this were the least of the test to which they were to be
subjected.</p>
<p>Preparation for their return to the Temple being completed, their
readiness was again communicated as before and to the solemn but
inspiring Andante of Faust they began to wind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>through
a path of serpentine evolutions. On their journey many strange and
threatening voices came to their ears, some cursing their undertaking
and advising them to return before too late, some whispering that they
were about to step into an abyss or to encounter dire disaster. But by
the guidance and occasional prod by the trident of timid and erratic
disciples they proceeded onward with cautious steps. When almost at the
end of their journey, however, there was a sharp cry from one of the
applicants which caused the procession to halt.</p>
<p>Lady Rosa Redmont Davitt, the daughter of an Irish noble,&mdash;a
comely girl, with laughing eyes, full of wit and humor and with a
strong combative instinct, withal very popular at the
seminary&mdash;gave vent to her distress in a piquant but pleasing
accent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Your Riverence,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;It is not that
I moind to ride the wild billy goat, or am afraid to swallow the
serpints, but divil a bit I can shtand this pinching of my goide, your
Riverince; my back is almost bhlack and bhlue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well that thou hast spoken,&rdquo; said the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>Priestess; &ldquo;it was because of thy
untractable erratic steps and non-susceptibility to the promptings of
thy guide that thou hast suffered, for according to the ratio of the
loyalty and sensitiveness to her touch, thy sufferings will come to an
end. Follow thou, then, fair maid, with keen perception to the subtle
touch of thy guide. Supreme Guide of the order of D. N. A. let the
procession proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The march having been resumed and finished, they stood thus
blindfolded before the High Priestess in order to be tested for courage
and fortitude. Each applicant was led by the guide before her, who, for
fortitude, administered the angle worm, and for courage trailed the
mouse over their limbs. It is perhaps unnecessary to mention that
macaroni was substituted for the angle worm and that an artificial
mouse served as a lively rodent.</p>
<p>When these sacred and solemn rites were performed the applicants
were taken through numerous evolutions of a march to the centre of the
room, in front of a table, whereon rested in the folds of American and
British colors the Constitution and By-laws of the Order. There the
oath of Allegiance was administered and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>at a thunderous outburst
of music, the bandages were cut asunder and the applicants found
themselves in the glow of a diffused light. Standing in the middle of
the room, surrounded by rows of graceful girls arrayed in immaculate
Grecian costumes, were all the other members of the Order. While the
High Priestess, majestically waving her sceptred arm, proclaimed them
tried and true members of D. N. A.</p>
<p>The ceremonies were concluded by the singing of the National
Anthems. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=

<p class="first">Margaret was reclining on a divan in her luxurious
study, perusing a letter. The room was redolent with the perfume of
June roses, and the warm rays of the afternoon sun, filtering through
the stained glass windows&mdash;now and then obscured by the swaying
leaves and branches of the trees&mdash;were flitting across her lovely
form as if playing hide and seek.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door burst open and Aurora, somewhat flushed, holding
in her hand a note, entered the room, exclaiming excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible! Margie, horrible! I do not know what to do! It will
be extremely h&rsquo;embawassing aw, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it Aurora, is that Jewsky after you
again?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e527src" href="#xd26e527" name=
"xd26e527src">1</a> asked Margaret with a rougish smile, glancing
toward her chum. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think he is a &rsquo;Ebrew, my dear, his signature
aw, is some foreign sounding name. Carlos Do-Do-Do-Don
Seville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care what he is. The dodo is an extinct
bird you know. He looks like a Jewsky anyway. The idea, pray what has
he to say?&rdquo; questioned Margaret, contracting her eyebrows to a
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writes that he will grace aw, our moonlight reception with
&rsquo;is presence. Horrid, Margie, horrid! I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks! Rats!&rdquo; retorted Margaret. &ldquo;It is up
to us then. If he bobs up tomorrow night at the show, there will be
something doing. That Dago is positively the limit. He is perfectly
horrid. If I see him ogling me once that night, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;cut
the chains of my tongue loose&rsquo; at him, the wretch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure p028width"><img src="images/p028.jpg" alt=
"&ldquo;Is the Jewski After You Again?&rdquo;" width="338" height=

<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;Is the Jewski After You Again?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, really, how brave you are Margie!&rdquo; replied Aurora,
looking admiringly at her classmate. &ldquo;You will not desert me? By
the way,&rdquo; went on Aurora, gradually recovering her composure,
&ldquo;I just met Norma Southworth coming from the modiste with her
graduation gown. It was such a bonnie gown, aw, so lurid and so sweet,
don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you hers won&rsquo;t cut any ice with my togs, when
they arrive tomorrow. Aurora, you and I will make a jim-dandy pair on
graduation day. I am curious, however, to get a glimpse of her dream of
a gown, but before we start, my dear, let us once more go over the
details of tomorrow night&rsquo;s event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me somewhat nervous to think about it. I wish truly
it was all h&rsquo;over, Margie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Aurora. I am afraid we&rsquo;ll make a beastly flunk
at the show, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah Jove, it will be awfully dweddful, Margie, to make a
failure, after so many months of preparation. I hope we will come
h&rsquo;out all right,&rdquo; said Aurora with thoughtful anxiety.</p>
<p>After they finished their examination of the program, both started
out to inspect Norma&rsquo;s gown, intending from thence to go to the
final rehearsal. While crossing the Grand Court of the Seminary they
spied Professor Cielo Allenson coming toward them on his
motor-cycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the dear <span class="corr" id="xd26e560" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>Old Guard<span class="corr" id=

&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e a dear, aw, isn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e
sweet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure Aurora, I am head over heels <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>in love
with his lilacs; aren&rsquo;t they elegant?&rdquo; was the ready
rejoinder of Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, what! aw, really, &rsquo;ow often must I caution you not
to use such h&rsquo;expressions,&rdquo; said Aurora, reproachfully.
&ldquo;&rsquo;E may &rsquo;ear you, Margie, &rsquo;e may &rsquo;ear
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, ring off, sweet child, you better pick up your
&lsquo;h&rsquo;s&rsquo; and get a gait on, or else we&rsquo;ll be late
for practice,&rdquo; laughed Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you do?&rdquo; piped both girls.</p>
<p>The professor, slackening his pace, greeted them courteously:
&ldquo;I presume you ladies are well prepared for the ordeal of
tomorrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, Professor; we are looking forward with extreme
pleasure to meeting our gallant adversaries under your charge,&rdquo;
answered Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;in fact, we are now going to our final
rehearsal,&rdquo; added Aurora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish you success, ladies; I must be off myself, to
give the boys at the Academy my last instructions; so
goodby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Professor; goodby.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The June graduation day of 1960 at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>Seminary was not far
distant, falling on the second week of the month. The recitations had
been discontinued and the only sessions that were held by the
professors were chiefly for purposes of review.</p>
<p>The students meanwhile beguiled their time by indulging in frequent
class receptions, which were given by the various grades and societies,
each vieing with others to excel all previous functions in originality,
splendor and novelty. That to be given by the senior class, to which
Aurora and Margaret belonged, was near at hand. Long before the date
agreed upon, the senior class had agreed to make it an out-of-door
affair eclipsing all previous efforts in brilliancy of conception and
prodigality of arrangements.</p>
<p>It was to be a &ldquo;<span lang="fr"><span class="corr" id=

moonlight dance and reception. Their guests of honor were to be no less
than embryo generals from the West Point Military Academy! Truly it was
a magnificent conception and it was chiefly due to the indefatigable

<p>The spacious, velvety lawn was profusely and fittingly decorated.
From column to column festoons of June roses and evergreens crossed and
entwined in bewildering array. The colossal statue of Diana with her
hounds&mdash;the patron Saint of the Seminary&mdash;and the alternate
gold and silver peristyles leading to the wondrously designed parterre,
were enveloped in a mass of phosphorescent glow from the radium
globules.</p>
<p>The statuettes and fountains were bejewelled by innumerable actinium
bulbs. Ensconced in the branches of the trees and bushes the electrical
nightingales gave forth their continuous warbles of subdued sweetness,
while from poles especially erected for the occasion electric globes in
kaleidoscopic hues diffused the ambient atmosphere with their
spirituelle glow. The moon, like an overseer, hung high in the canopy
of space, casting its silvery light over the radiant scene.</p>
<p>The graceful figures of the maidens in their fantastic winged
costumes of Celestial Amazons, and the grotesque forms of the boys,
attired in Indian outfits, glittering with beads and
feathers&mdash;&ldquo;chaperoned&rdquo; by the venerable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>Professor Cielo Allenson&mdash;each tribe in turn
illustrating their weird national customs, in war or peace, in mirth or
sorrow, filled the select spectators with throes of thrilling
excitement. What hitherto had seemed only ordinary, mundane
surroundings was changed into a realistic happy-hunting-ground or
savage fairyland, a vision of alternate celestial or barbaric splendor,
the grandeur of which is beyond the power of human ability to
describe.</p>
<p>The secret of unparalleled excellence of the disguises of the boys
was due to the fact that at the end of the Freshmen year at the
Military Academy, when they were preparing for the celebration of their
academic year, the Sophomores had kidnapped the whole Freshmen Class,
and by a pre-arranged plan, experts having been hired, had tatooed them
all over their faces as Indians on the warpath, thus leaving a lasting
souvenir of class antagonism! Being disfigured for life, they had made
the best of their misfortune by appearing in the role of Indian
warriors, delighted that for once this misfortune had proven an
advantage.</p>
<p>There was nothing to mar this auspicious occasion except that, near
its close, a trivial wordy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>demonstration took place between
Professor Cielo Allenson and an intruder named Carlos Don Seville.</p>
<p>Still, even the most pleasant and successful events have their
aftermath and this affair left several of them. When Aurora and
Margaret entered their rooms heaped with triumphant compliments for
their consummate skill in planning this grand farewell <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e623" title="Source: f&eacute;te">f&ecirc;te</span> they
were sad, sad through an impulsive intuition.</p>
<p>Hardly had they crossed the threshold of their room when they fell
into each other&rsquo;s arms, sobbing bitterly from the bottom of their
hearts. Each instinctively knew why the other wept. The final class
reception had a deep significance to them, as it meant that graduation
day was near at hand. In the natural course of events each would now go
her way to a distant home. It meant separation!</p>
<p>Separation! It was impossible for them calmly to accept the full
significance of that word in their infatuation for each other. Some
time elapsed before either gained sufficient composure to speak. Each
attempt resulted in a collapse and a paroxysm of hysterical weeping.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Margaret, as if dazed with the frenzy of that strange passion, clung
to Aurora, exclaiming hysterically: &ldquo;How can it be, Aurora? It
cannot be. It cannot be! Better death than separation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the gentle, soothing words of Aurora, however, they gradually
recovered their composure, but were not fully pacified until that very
night they made a solemn compact, bound by an inviolable oath, not to
make any alliance with any suitor whatever and to remain united to each
other in souls until death should them part.</p>
<p>It was that night also that in the height of their fatuous ardor of
love Aurora wrote an impromptu poem of fealty, entitled &ldquo;Wilt
Thou Remember Thy Vow?&rdquo; It revealed the intensity of their
emotions, their utter subjugation and mutual abandonment of will and
desire each to the other and its dire revenge in the end, if their
solemn vow was betrayed.</p>
<p>Like the poem, the music which was composed by Margaret, was also an
inspiration. It interpreted the poem in a sad, sublimely pathetic
strain, yet at times in bold and threatening torrents of color and
passion. The very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>spirit of the words and the oath, that would
be their guiding star throughout their lives, surged through it. In all
respects it was a masterpiece of symphonic creation. <span class=

Professor Cielo Allenson. He had just begun his review of the
historical events of the 20th Century, now and then giving his
individual comments upon the subjects presented.</p>

<h3 class="main">An Era of False Prosperity</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the beginning of the 20th Century was inaugurated
an era of false prosperity. The Census Bureau at that time furnishes
statistics and comments upon the wonderfully perceptible decrease of
the criminal classes, called foot-pads, sneak thieves and highwaymen,
which was attributed chiefly to the existing national prosperity. It
overlooks the fact, however, that a new species of miscreants,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>comparatively more dangerous, had begun to thrive
like mushrooms in prolific numbers,&mdash;that of so-called
<i>commercial brigands</i> or <i>financial buccaneers</i> who, under
fascinating and attractive names, such as mining syndicates with their
fabulous deposits of gold, offering bucketfuls of shares for a dime;
banking and building loan associations, with palatial homes thrown in
gratis to every subscriber; promoters of illusionary inventions,
seeking shareholders, which would make them millionaires in the
twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Alchemists who, with their artful empyrics of legerdemain,
transmuted base metals into gold, and were willing to dispose of their
precious wares for pennies; Wall Street and race-track spiders posing
as benevolent philanthropists, scattering fortunes right and left to
every applicant, sapped the avaricious, sottish public of its dearly
bought earnings. Strange to say, despite many colossal exposures and
failures, as these adroit swindlers grew more subtle and audacious, the
more the gambling-crazed public rushed to their destruction.</p>
<p>The effect was appalling. In consequence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>of the
depredations of these pirates of industries, the reputable business and
financial firms were the greatest sufferers. Their legitimate
transactions were paralyzed to such a tremendous degree that they were
compelled to devise ways and means to counteract its evils. In 1908,
after mature deliberation at a general convention in Washington, it was
decided to raise ample funds and create a bureau under the auspices of
the Federal Government called the <i>Bureau of Frauds and Swindles</i>.
The duties imposed upon its officers were the ferreting out and
prosecuting of the wild-cat schemes and to warn the public against
them.</p>
<p>The measure, being approved by the National Government, had the
desired effect of freeing to a great degree the financial world from
its parasites of industrial malefactors, and to some extent established
again the stability and integrity of honorable financiers, in the
meanwhile safeguarding foolish persons from being fleeced out of their
savings.</p>

overwhelming aggressiveness played an important factor in the stamping

<h3 class="main">Capital and Labor</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Every new movement, be it religious, political or
economic, has its birth like a volcano, and unionism was no exception
to this rule. The labor unions at first had their violent agitators
who, possessing greater physical than mental calibre, laid the crude
foundation of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>force in an arbitrary manner that consequently had
its gradual evolution of development.</p>
<p>Their constant conflicts with capital were characterized by an
unreasonable amount of physical argument which resulted in more or less
disastrous denouements, but these very acts of lawlessness and
disturbances awakened a third party, the consumers in general, who were
equally affected by the disturbances between capital and labor and
brought about a realization of the true relative positions.</p>
<p>Labor certainly has its unalienable rights and was entitled to due
consideration and justice. However, like the negative and positive
poles of electricity, which are both essential in order that a circuit
of effective force be generated, capital and labor likewise had their
dual relative values of importance, without which there could be no
constancy of harmonious production.</p>
<p>By the gradual awakening of both capital and labor to their true
limitations, the questions involved began to assume a more intelligent
basis under the codes of arbitration. At the same time the violent
agitators of labor were succeeded in the trend of this onward
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>development by more intelligent organizers. These
latter were merged into accomplished, rational leaders and, through the
efficient medium of the ballot box, into national representatives.
Consequently, the more dignified, orderly and responsible labor became,
the more the workers became entitled to the benefits of their
labor.</p>
<p>A Department of Capital and Labor which, so far, had been merely
probationary now became a permanent institution at the Capitol and in
every State of the Union as well.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Expense of Living</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is one of the strangest inconsistencies of social
problems, that although political economists and scholars have preached
the doctrine, that inventions and improved methods in mechanical lines
contribute to the blessings of mankind by cheapening the necessities of
life, yet in spite of their plausible declarations, the cost of living
year by year grew higher and higher, entailing untold suffering and
despair among the poorer classes.</p>
<p>The cause of this lamentable perversion was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>due to a
certain clique of unscrupulous progeny of Mammon, called trusts and
corporations, who, being blinded with an insatiable desire for pelf and
lust, and stupefied with a frenzied avarice, monopolized all the
necessities of life. The vast occidental domain of our country was of
unlimited resources and was capable of producing in abundance the
products which they &ldquo;cornered.&rdquo; The <i lang="la">modus
operandi</i> of their rapacious operations were manifold. They limited
the output of Nature&rsquo;s bounty in order to keep them at
prohibitive values, and at the same time deprived hosts of sons of toil
of earning their livelihood. They kept at their inoperative
mercy&mdash;by their abominable tactics of purchase&mdash;the producer
from receiving his just share, and they also mulcted the helpless
consumer by the unlimited inflation of their capital stock and
fictitious expenses until at length the burden of their avarice became
unendurable.</p>
<p>Although attempts have repeatedly been made by sincere executives of
the Nation, by the advocation of measures for curbing the rapacity of
these trusts, their endeavors met with failure on account of the vague
and flexible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>laws already in existence, and by the array of
sycophantic traitors in high circles who prevented any legislation
which was conducive to the tranquility and welfare of the masses. At
last, only after a series of sanguinary demonstrations by the people
which almost endangered the stability of the republic, they were
compelled to yield.</p>
<p>By the passage of clearly defined laws the career of their nefarious
system of spoliation was brought to an end. One of the most efficacious
laws passed was the creation of a body of competent men of supreme
power who appraised approximately the capitalization of these concerns
and licensed them as such under oath. The States in the meantime
assumed the power of fixing a maximum value for which their commodities
might be placed on the market. By the above legislations the inflation
of their capital and extortion from the consumer were made securely
impossible.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the mortality statistics in the United States
for last year reached the round number of two million persons from
various diseases, among them chiefly from consumption, pneumonia,
typhoid fever and epidemics of smallpox and diphtheria, a few sporadic
cases of death were recorded resulting from mosquito bites, which gave
grave concern to the medical fraternity.</p>
<p>The outcome of this alarm was the calling of a general conference of
bacteriological experts. The mosquito, that had hitherto enjoyed
unbridled freedom since the creation of his race, was now looked upon
as the arch enemy of mankind. A noted philanthropist, interested in oil
wells and having on hand a great bulk of unmarketable crude petroleum,
donated a large sum for research in order to discover ways and means of
curbing the ravages of these nefarious pests which threatened the
annihilation of the human race. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was decided by the savants, that the distribution of crude
petroleum in stagnant pools and humid marshes, was the only effective
method for the extermination of mosquito life. The distribution of
greenbacks for their valuable services, (notwithstanding the fact that
under the microscope they were found to contain two hundred and
fifty-seven diseases and thirty-eight million microbes to the square
inch), were grabbed with unprecedented avidity by these same
specialists.</p>

<p class="first">The Women&rsquo;s Clubs which, during their first
inception, were the subject of much ridicule, and the proceedings of
their meetings a theme for ribald jokes in the secular press, gradually
developed into such gigantic proportions that their influence became a
powerful factor in every public question of the day, and in fact so
continues unabated unto this day.</p>
<p>The last Federal statistics show more than two thousand Institutions
in the form of sanitariums, refuges, technical schools of practical
utility, entirely under the auspices of Club Women. The constitutions
of these laudable organizations &ldquo;invariably stand for something
which is ennobling&rdquo; and their achievements are monumental
tributes to the upward trend of womanhood.</p>
<p>There was, however, a crucial period in their affairs worth
mentioning. Some of these noble but over-zealous women of that period,
in their exuberant enthusiasm for woman&rsquo;s rights, forgetting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>the limitations of their sex,&mdash;considered by
the greatest thinkers of the past ages to be the sphere of
Home,&mdash;agitated a propaganda of political equality or suffrage
and, from time to time, created a stir among their organizations until
at last, in 1918, the National Federation of Women&rsquo;s Clubs
decided to hold a conclave in order to decide the following momentous
question: &ldquo;Should Women Enter Politics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than four thousand five hundred delegates from all over the
Union assembled at Madison Square Garden, in New York City.
Sympathizers of the suffragists with their eloquence tried to railroad
through a measure in their behalf, but equally able leaders of the
opposition&mdash;benefitted by the warning of Sages&mdash;succeeded in
counterbalancing the efforts of their fair antagonists.</p>
<p>After a heated symposium the question was put to a vote, which
resulted decisively in a victory for those who opposed the movement. It
was further voted, that they should confine all their energies to
civic, educational and humanitarian channels and things pertaining to
Home. This was a most happy and wise decision, <span class=

<h3 class="main">The Power of the Press</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Through emancipation from its shackles of monarchic
censorship and subserviency to despotic masters, the upward rise of the
Press to usefulness and power was without a parallel&mdash;a power to
which even Napoleon Bonaparte was sensible when he said, &ldquo;I fear
three newspapers more than a hundred thousand bayonets.&rdquo; But like
everything else in the universe, the Press also had its dual
potentiality. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>Like a two-edged sword, it could be wielded for
good or evil. In the bands of an unscrupulous politician it was a
treacherous weapon, while in the control of the righteous citizen a
tremendous power for good.</p>
<p>Thus the Press for many decades, subsidized by the traitorous
capitalist and under the guise of a pious mask, catered to the evil
designs of the plutocracy until the gradual awakening of the people
through the independent press at last understood their hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The independent press, however, attained its highest degree of
efficiency by the establishment of the College of Journalism. Its
foundation slogan, <i>publicity</i> on all political and economic
questions, had created a force of trained journalists&mdash;a force
&ldquo;mightier than the sword&rdquo; and in a manner far more
penetrating than the X-ray&mdash;pledged to defend the rights of the
citizens. By an educational propaganda it taught the masses how to
eradicate existing evils by the mere exercise of their unalienable
right, the ballot box. Indeed in a government &ldquo;of the people, for
the people and by the people,&rdquo; resort to force or revolution was
absolutely unnecessary, while these two <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the world had ever seen, the voting power and the free press, were at

to Otto Lilienthal, and from <span class="corr" id="xd26e852" title=
"Source: Montgoflier">Montgolfier</span> Bros. to Santos Dumont, Bell,
Maxim and Langley, very little or no progress had been made in
practical and safe aerial navigation.</p>
<p>Though all these inventors, whether cranks with a smattering of
mechanical knowledge, or veritable savants and scientists, efficient in
physics according to their own accounts, had studied the subject of
aerial flight from the fowls of the air, the failure of their
experiments showed that they were far from grasping the mysteries of
that subtle sagacity and subconsciousness of the birds, by which they
balanced themselves against the currents and velocity of the winds, and
by their intuitive sensitiveness, utilized to the fullest extent their
vast number of muscles and feathers with such marvelous subtlety.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=

<p>Like the Italian alchemist in the middle ages, who had constructed
the wings of his flying machine with feathers gathered from a dunghill,
and who, when attempting to fly, had found himself dumped, by a strange
sympathetic affinity, on the very dunghill from which he had gathered
the feathers, the efforts likewise, of these illustrious experimenters
were crowned by successful failures, by a similar force of attraction,
their apparatus either alighting on the branches of trees, or diving
into the waters like ducks.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th Century, the consensus of scientific
opinion had reached the conclusion, that the successful flying machine
of the future would be one, which would be heavier than air and with
either a very small balloon or none at all. The various forms of
balloons and flying craft, exhibited at the St. Louis exposition became
an incentive for renewed efforts by scientists to solve the problem of

<h3 class="main">The Zionist Movement<br>
or<br>
The Bursting of the Zion Bubble</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Zionist movement which for thirty years past
gained more than two million converts and within that period had
collected more than fifteen million dollars, was declared impracticable
and illusionary!</p>
<p>The estimable originators of this sentimental movement, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e895" title="Source: Herzle">Herzl</span>, Nordau,
Zangwill and others, although beyond the shadow of a doubt sincere and
well-meaning, through the intensity of their zeal for the amelioration
of their less fortunate brethren, were entirely blindfolded to the
intricacies of politics and the eventful history of the Jewish race,
from an ethnological and psychological point of view.</p>
<p>Some of these true yet misguided philanthropists had passed away and
other leaders, less impressed with the object of the society, had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>taken their places. As the Jews are not a pioneer
race, the magnanimous scheme of the British government to place them
upon a tract of virgin soil at Uganda, in Central Africa, for the
purpose of colonization proved chaotic failure, on account of both
sociological and economic reasons.</p>
<p>The idea also of establishing a Jewish principality in Palestine,
under an absolutely despotic and semi-barbarous government&mdash;which
butchered her subjects <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>&mdash;was so
ridiculous in the extreme, that the questions had become the laughing
stock at the political <i lang="la">sanctus sanctorums</i> of various
governments.</p>
<p>In 1923 a tremendous agitation was brought about by the leaders of
the opposition, and those in power of the movement were challenged to
public debate. The question grew to such proportions that it became a
subject for discussion in every orthodox and gentile pulpit In the
press, sociologists, ethnologists and anthropologists took part in the
ephemeral arena and analyzed every phase of the subject, relating to
the Hebrew race and the Zionist movement, laying bare every fact
without reserve. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was stated by the opposition that though a stream of money had
been pouring in from every quarter of the globe year after year, for
the cause, no result as yet had been obtained, that great sums had been
spent in salaries of the officials and at the dilly-dallying, corrupt
courts of the Turkish Sultan.</p>
<p>A learned sociologist likened the Hebrews to a parasitic plant,
which derived its existence from the living sap of another. &ldquo;An
Israelite&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;can only exist favorably amongst
civilized centres of Christian and gentile communities; that whenever a
colony of Hebrews were isolated by themselves, they would inevitably
and gradually retrograde, impoverish and at last form a ghetto of
misery and squalor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another ethnologist of repute expounded the fact, that the Jews were
the life and essence of commercial activity and consequently formed an
integral part of a prosperous <span class="corr" id="xd26e919" title=
"Source: common-wealth">commonwealth</span>. Sublimely industrious,
instinctively provident and economical by nature, the Jews were
persecuted because of their inherent virtues. He proved by clever
historical documents, that their expulsion from Babylon, Egypt, Spain,
Russia or wherever their rights <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60"
href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>were abrogated, were the
fundamental causes of the decadence of these countries from which they
were expelled.</p>
<p>Others accused the Hebrews of perverting the Golden Rule, of taking
advantage of others by their inborn instinct of commercial sagacity,
which well nigh approached unscrupulousness and that, being a mere
commercial people, their patriotism could well be challenged. Many
others advised, however, a propaganda of judicious assimilation of the
Israelite with the Christians, contending that the sum total of their
virtues and faults was the same as that of their Christian brethren.
Meanwhile they advised the Jews that &ldquo;wherever they lived they
ought to make there, their Zions and temples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much heated argument and discussion which occupied several
days, they at last arrived at the conclusion that the Zionist movement
was chimerical! The balance of the funds amounting to many million
dollars were voted for the establishment of technical and commercial
schools for Israelites and for a fund to aid the judicious emigration
of the Jews from ill-favored and congested districts to more favorable
localities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

<p class="first">The Anglo-American Alliance, by which these two
foremost nations of the earth were brought into a happy, fraternal
union, and for the achievement of which for nearly a quarter of a
century there had been a great effort, in this year had become an
accomplished fact!</p>
<p>It was celebrated in a manner unprecedented in the annals of the
World&rsquo;s history. Having a profound and far reaching effect, it
became an ultimatum for other nations to keep the peace, and goaded
them toward the adoption of similar laws, in order to secure the same
reciprocal blessings of universal brotherhood.</p>
<p>Much credit was due to that eminent English statesman, now Lord
Cunningham, through whose tactful diplomacy this long-sought
commercial, social, offensive and defensive alliance became a reality.
&ldquo;I am restrained,&rdquo; said the Professor, looking in the
direction of Aurora Cunningham, &ldquo;to avoid eulogizing him as he
justly deserves, for obvious reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this sentence the students, under the impulse of a sudden
admiration, arose to their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href=

smilingly at Aurora, began rapturously to clap their hands.</p>
<p>This interruption of sympathetic appreciation was brought to a
close, by a ringing cry of the Seminary yell: &ldquo;Dee, Dee, Ya, Ya,

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Fistic Duel</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The evening following the moonlight <span class="corr"
id="xd26e958" title="Source: f&eacute;te">f&ecirc;te</span>, a little
after sunset when the western sky, stained with a luminous golden hue,
had spread on verdant hills and valleys its radiance of languorous
serenity, two motor cyclists were speeding along on a secluded path
that led into the main highway, from the Diana Seminary to the West
Point Military Academy. The one in advance was wheeling in a leisurely
way, while the one behind exerted greater speed, as if in pursuit of
the other. He was gaining rapidly so that in a very few minutes the
foremost was overtaken, as they both reached a wooden bridge, spanning
a small body of water.</p>
<p>Both came suddenly to a stop and dismounted. They were Professor
Cielo Allenson and Carlos Don Seville. Don Seville, stung by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>the rebuke which the Professor had administered to
him the night previous at the Seminary, had decided to take the
cowardly course of waylaying the instructor, in this lonely path, in
order to avenge himself for the righteous verbal punishment the latter
had given him.</p>
<p>Carlos Don Seville was a degenerate scion of a once noble Spanish
family, who had settled in the United States and, like many such
offspring, was engaged in sowing his wild oats. Financially dependent
on a small income, he was always at his wit&rsquo;s end in order to
secure money with which to continue his reckless profligacy. Being
inherently foolish and improvident, he always had the illusion that
some day &ldquo;something would turn up,&rdquo; and encouraged by this
belief he had recourse to gambling and speculation. As soon as he
received his dwindled allowance, he made himself a willing prey of card
sharps and get-rich-quick brigands.</p>
<p>Lately, however, he had conceived the idea of marrying an heiress,
and for that purpose he was hovering about Diana Seminary, annoying the
young ladies by his unsolicited attentions, or by brazen audacity
intruding unceremoniously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>upon their receptions. His snobbish
mendacity reached its climax when at the night of the moonlight
<span class="corr" id="xd26e971" title=
"Source: soiree">soir&eacute;e</span> he accosted Aurora and Margaret
at the intermission of the dance, while they were sauntering arm-in-arm
along the parterre to a trysting nook.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Margaret&rsquo;s bold declaration of the previous
day, that she wanted to give the &ldquo;Jewsky&rdquo; a piece of her
mind, the feminine temerity and reserve had taken possession of her.
The minute they saw him advance they took to their heels, and scampered
back with appealing gestures toward Professor Allenson who, divining at
once the situation, came gallantly to their rescue, giving Don Seville
a scathing reprimand and commanding him to depart, &ldquo;unless he
desired,&rdquo; announced the Professor, &ldquo;to be skinned alive by
the war dogs of the Military Academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Seville, frightened and abashed, beat an inglorious retreat and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Professor Cielo Allenson, better known at the Military Academy as
the &ldquo;Old Guard,&rdquo; was a venerable man past seventy. He had a
highly intellectual countenance and his silvery white hair and
patriarchal beard gave him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>a noble dignity which commanded
respect. His strenuous virility and inexhaustible energy was ever a
lesson and a rebuke to the many indolent youths who came in contact
with him. He was a philosopher of the first rank and an intense lover
of nature. Imbued with the deeper knowledge of the subtle workings of
natural phenomena, &ldquo;he could not draw a line,&rdquo; he would
say, &ldquo;between the manifestations of human, animal and vegetable
kingdoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt you d&mdash;&mdash;d old cur! I demand no apology, but
satisfaction,&rdquo; snarled Don Seville abruptly, his face livid with
anger.</p>
<p>For a second the Professor was taken aback. But in that very second,
through his intuitive and resourceful mind flashed the fact that he was
&ldquo;cornered.&rdquo; He was not a man easily frightened, for as a
Major of Volunteers during the Panama and Columbian trouble, and while
in his teens, he had led on his handful of men up the hills against the
ramparts of the enemy.</p>
<p>But a problem which required instantaneous solution was now
presented to him by Carlos Don Seville. It was a problem which neither
diplomacy, moral persuasion nor flight of oratory <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>could
solve. He realized in that very second that the only way out of this
difficulty was to take the coward at his word. It was to be a fistic
encounter to the finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apology, I have none to offer you sir, and am ready to give
you such satisfaction as you desire,&rdquo; replied the old man with a
dignified firmness.</p>
<p>A remarkable change had taken place in the person of Cielo Allenson.
That venerable and spirituelle individual had been transformed in a
twinkling of an eye, into a grim and determined looking animal, and
like an expert gladiator of the fistic arena, he took the attitude of
self-defense.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;ring&rdquo; constituted the platform of the wooden
bridge, the side rails of which served as the partial ropes. There were
no seconds to goad their favorites into action, no referee to decide
the doubtful or unlawful blows, no gong to mark the rounds, nor
time-keeper to count the defeated out of action. In the languorous glow
of the twilight their shadows, reflected in black silhouettes in the
placid waters below, were the only silent witnesses of this remarkable
encounter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>The contest was constant and in the vernacular of pugilism, superbly
game, fast and furious! After the acceptance of the challenge there was
no parley between them, but by a sudden rush, Don Seville with his
right hand landed a hammering blow on the Professor&rsquo;s skull,
which the latter parried with his left with dexterous agility and thus
saved a crisis, for if left unchecked the blow would have reached his
&ldquo;solar plexus.&rdquo; In rapid succession the fight continued,
Don Seville taking the aggressive and the Professor acting more in
self-defense. However, as often as opportunity presented, the latter
put in a few well aimed jabs, here and there, on the vital points of
Don Seville&rsquo;s anatomy. At the same time it was apparent that Don
Seville was getting the best of the contest. The venerable Professor
unused to long continued strain of the kind, began to experience
difficulty in breathing, and this did not escape Don Seville&rsquo;s
observation. Shortly, however, a remarkable change was visible; the
Professor seemed to grow stronger with each onslaught he made. He had
gained his so-called &ldquo;second wind&rdquo; thereby recouping his
adroitness and elasticity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the consummate skill of a scientific boxer, several times he
feigned signs of weakness, by giving false openings, of which his
infuriated antagonist attempted to avail himself, thinking the
Professor to be on the verge of collapse, only to receive in return
several well directed right and left swings on the jaw. These staggered
Don Seville to his knees, but he was allowed to rise to his feet by the
generous tolerance of the Professor, and the consciousness of this
humility caused him to wage the attack with reckless fury. With vulgar
oaths he began to resort to foul tactics, trying to hit the defender
beyond the limits of decent pugilism.</p>
<p>Don Seville&rsquo;s endurance had now come to its end. His youth,
dissipated by debauchery, was undermined of its stability, and in spite
of the wide disparity of ages the old man had Don Seville absolutely in
his power. It was time, he thought, to terminate these proceedings, so
distasteful and undignified to him, but the only way he saw was, to lay
aside the tactics of self defense, and adopt those of a punitive
retaliation.</p>
<p>With keen alertness he watched for an opportunity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>and when
Don Seville, almost crazed with anger, rushed on him for a clinch,
entirely oblivious of the intention of the Professor, the latter gave a
sudden shift to his position by swinging his body away from his
antagonist Don Seville blindly followed him in his determination of a
desperate onslaught. It was then that the venerable Allenson shot out a
driving &ldquo;right upper cut&rdquo; to the jaw.</p>
<p>This was the finale! Don Seville staggered to the rails and toppling
over fell with a splash into the limpid waters below.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Final Blow</p>
</div>
<p>The Professor promptly jumped down the embankment and pulled out his
still unconscious adversary. If abandoned in that condition the young
man might have drowned in the shallow waters. The Professor began to do
all in his power to restore him to consciousness; just at that time a
farmhand on horseback appeared on the scene, and by his aid the Academy
ambulance was summoned and Don Seville was taken to the military
hospital. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=

admirers, who were augmented from the other classes, on account of the
full detail of his encounter with Don Seville having been spread
throughout the Seminary.</p>
<p>The Professor, despite some discoloration on his benign visage,
flushed crimson like a bashful child and bowed his acknowledgements, as
he began his discourse thus:</p>

<h3 class="main">1927</h3>
<h3 class="main">Colonization of Central Africa</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A system of general colonization on a large scale was,
during this year, undertaken by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72"
href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>British Government. By a new
homestead law, embodying liberal inducements, a vast army of colonists
from all over the British dominions were transported to Central Africa.
Thousands upon thousands of persons from the congested districts of
London, Glasgow, Liverpool and other large cities, were persuaded to
leave their limited surroundings and uncongenial atmosphere, and go to
the promising new land, teeming with boundless opportunities.</p>
<p>Almost the entire inhabitants of the isolated islands of the
Shetlands and Orkneys, who led an indolent life and eked a meagre
existence by fisheries, joined this grand trek to Central Africa. Many
thousands from the Canadian provinces and from the United States of
America joined this exodus, as did also thousands from the East Indies.
The thorough and admirable manner in which this laudable movement was
handled mitigated the hardships of transportation, and thus within a
few years more than five million, poor, homeless and indolent people
were given homesteads of their own, awakening them into energy and
thrift. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>Within a decade the population of Central Africa reached the grand
total of 25,000,000 industrious, loyal citizens, forming a flourishing
dependency, enjoying home rule and liberty, under the protection of
British laws and arms.</p>

that of the apparent burning of the Atlantic Ocean, covering an area
one hundred and fifty miles wide. It started in the Gulf of Mexico and,
like a prairie fire, only a thousand times more furious, this floating
furnace consumed scores of vessels that came into its fiery path.</p>
<p>A few weeks previous to this awful holocaust, the petroleum wells in
Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana had run dry, on account of a severe
earthquake. It was argued by scientists that, by some subterranean
convulsions the oil well fissures had shifted their course, into the
waters of the gulf, and the vast accumulation of the inflammable fluid,

disturbances of public comfort.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable features of this Court of Arbitration
was, the colossal group erected between the two grand entrances to the

holding in her hand the conventional pair of scales, but a Herculean
figure of Uncle Sam with his starry hat and glorious chin whiskers,
having three faces, three eyes and three arms. Before him were a group

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the most scandalous evils which had crept
gradually in the United States, and eventually became a source of grave
anxiety to the government, was a system of Landlordism amongst the very
rich. While the general public were slumbering in blissful ignorance,
this coterie of avaricious syndicates and multi-millionaires had
mysteriously become possessors of vast tracts of lands, in every state
of the Union. Some of these holdings comprised hundreds and thousands
of square miles in extent.</p>
<p>Miles and miles of shore-fronts, immense areas of forests, whole
mountains and lakes, through the conniving, corrupt state and county
officials, had passed into the hands of private individuals who, in
return had become extremely arrogant in their treatment of the public,
by unreasonable restriction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>There seemed to be a mocking sarcasm in the fact when common people
sang the National Anthem &ldquo;America,&rdquo; celebrating its hills
and rills, while at every turn of the road, at every shore-front, lake,
hill and valley, mountain and forests, the forbidding sign, &ldquo;No
Trespassing Under Penalty,&rdquo; met their eyes, or the repulsive
muzzle of the Winchester was thrust into their faces by private
watchmen.</p>
<p>This state of affairs had reached such desperate straits, that the
public suddenly awakened on the subject. It started first by the
protest of the rougher element in the mountain districts, who defied
the hired authorities with an organized force. The people committed
acts of violence and incendiarism it is true, but by their overt acts
they awakened the dormant public to realize the enormity of this
scandalous condition of deeding away to millionaires, without the
consent of the commonwealth, the common and inalienable heritage of its
citizens.</p>
<p>By a unanimous uprising and public mandate the Federal and State
authorities were compelled to condemn and confiscate these stolen
public lands. New laws were then enacted by which the acquiring of
extensive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=

by a system of depots and rendez-vous for supplies, formed almost a

<p>All the latest devices in the form of dynamo-vans and motor-sleds,

<p class="first">The agitation for the abolition of hereditary titles
in England caused a crisis in the political and social world of Great
Britain. The degeneracy of hereditary nobles, their utter incapacity
adequately to fill the positions left by their illustrious ancestors,
to the detriment and retrogression of the British government, was the
main cause of bringing about this bloodless internecine revolution.</p>
<p>Despite the most strenuous opposition by the friends of the nobles,
a new law was added to the revised Magna Charta, by an overwhelming
public demand. With few exceptions, it nullified the existing titles,
and elevated to peerage only worthy citizens for life, on condition of
the good behavior of the incumbent. This excellent law brought fresh
and saving blood into the political and civic life of England. The
movement precipitated the abandonment of the House of Lords and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=

whose members were elected by the tax-paying citizens.</p>

a German scientist and statistician who, after a thorough investigation
and mathematical calculation, announced his conclusions, that it was in
the range of collective human power, that is, by the combined aid of
labor, time, money and high explosives, to rend the earth in twain, or
into fragments, and thus create new planets in space, producing new
climatic conditions, fauna and life, adaptable to their new positions

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=

dollars for their maintenance.</p>
<p>At last by the stress of popular agitation the government adopted a
policy of penal colonization. Selecting a desirable island in the
Philippines, the Federal authorities succeeded in transporting to the
island, within three years, and with half the cost of their maintenance
at home, one hundred thousand of these unfortunate malefactors.</p>
<p>Here, they were given every facility and aid, for acquiring and
building of homes, farms and factories, and within ten years, under a
wise military administration more than half of that number were
reclaimed, forming a prosperous and loyal community in the Eastern
Hemisphere.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Trend of Religious Thought</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Religious thought or spiritual belief is not an
invention of mortals. It is an inborn attribute of the human mind.
While man was in his savage or semi-barbarous stage, the ethical and
spiritual conceptions were correspondingly crude and religious warfare
predominated. With the advance of civilization its development kept
pace with it until at the dawn of the twentieth century it had
undergone, by natural evolution, a marked metamorphosis. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>It gradually divested itself of its legendary mysticism, fantastic
dogmas and spectacular schisms, and all intelligent thinkers
promulgated a propaganda, not of external forms of worship, but those
uncontrovertible basic truths, which always will hold.</p>
<p>It is true that in an era of commercial materialism great masses of
people embraced agnosticism and ethical culture, rejecting that
supernatural conception of a first cause of which they claimed their
limited intellect had a vague idea and was deeper than the hazy human
comprehension, yet, the shallow Ingersolian philosophy of attacking a
force&mdash;which filled millions with hope and goaded them to
self-sacrifice, mercy and charity&mdash;without substituting something
better, was repudiated by the intelligent, and appealed only to the
abnormal and the foolish.</p>
<p>This tendency of materialism in religion continued unabated, until
the startling announcement of a German scientist&mdash;who claimed it
was within human power to rend the world in twain&mdash;also the
marvelous revelation through the mammoth telescope&mdash;by which was
discovered moving objects and vegetation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>in other
planets&mdash;brought on an acute crisis. A tremendous religious
revival swept all over the world. It expanded the mental horizon of
human conceptions. The existence of living organism in other spheres
came within rational deductions. The possible existence of beings far
superior in intellect to ourselves, came within the limit of legitimate
theorizations, and the more men began to grasp with the co-operation of
science, the infinite vastness of the universe, with its numberless
millions of habitable worlds, the probability of an intelligent force
of vast creative power came within the scope of human
understanding.</p>
<p>The forceful passage in the Holy Writ &ldquo;that God created man in
his own image&rdquo; became more and more lucid. Consequently the
pantheism of the old Greeks were revived with more clearness, and the
existence of a personal God somewhere in this boundless universe
appealed to multitudes with new zest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, Professor, what is your opinion of a first
cause?&rdquo; ventured one of the students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many mysterious forces,&rdquo; answered the
Professor, &ldquo;that although we cannot see, yet we feel their power
and are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>conscious of their results. And as our mortal
organism cannot conceive a thought which is beyond its own limitations,
the very idea of our thought of a first cause falls within the range of
human conceptions.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e1201" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>When we gaze at an automobile, which is
the creation of a creature, we see a wonderful parallelism; its
requirements to make it an active energy, bears a strong analogy of its
inventor, yet, an automobile with all its requirements for power
supplied, is a worthless mass, unless operated and guided by its
creator. Does not this vast universe with all its wonderful
manifestations suggest a creative force, which governs it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Albeit, it is not within my province nor in my power to
penetrate the veil&rdquo; continued the Professor, looking up in
pensive mood. <span class="corr" id="xd26e1206" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>But as the coral protoplasm begins its
edifice from the calcerous mire in the dark recesses of the ocean,
upwards through the murky and semi-transparent liquid, finally reaches
the pelucid surface, kisses the wave and sees the light, me-thinks
likewise, the spiritual perceptions of mankind which has grown from the
depths of savagery and through the maze of intolerance, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>dogmas
and schisms, will go onward in its evolution and perhaps our posterity
will at last penetrate the mystic veil and see the
light,&mdash;God.<span class="corr" id="xd26e1211" title=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Regatta</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was still one great event before the closing of
the academic year of the Diana Seminary Seniors, in which the class had
taken extraordinary interest. It was the first time in the history of
the Seminary that students were to take part in aquatic sports against
male contestants. The day for the great handicap regatta&mdash;a
four-oared affair&mdash;between the Senior class of the Seminary and
the Sophomore class of the West Point Military Academy followed
directly after graduation,&mdash;the class grade being the handicap
allowed to the Seminary girls.</p>
<p>Aurora and Margaret, after their avowal and covenant, were again in
normal condition, cheerful as of yore, and as they were the most
available pair for the aquatic contest, from the beginning they had
been chosen unanimously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>as the exponents of the class of
1960, and they went into the execution of the sport with vim and
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As the event was a unique one, it had become the most lively topic
of conversation among the people, and long before it took place had
caused widespread interest in the country. Having been advertised and
exploited extensively in the daily press, it is needless to say that an
unusually large concourse of visitors had arrived by land and water to
witness the classic and unusual contest.</p>
<p>The course of the race was laid near Poughkeepsie and was in the
shape of a heart, that is, starting at a given point, side by side,
they raced about half a mile abreast, then one crew turning to port and
the other to starboard, diverging in a parabolic circle, passed each
other in the center within a short distance of the starting point, and
making counter-circles started on the home run, again abreast. (<i>See
diagram, page <a href="#p090" class="pageref">90</a>.</i>)</p>
<p>The personnel of the Seminary crew consisted of the following young
ladies: Aurora Cunningham, coxswain; Margaret MacDonald, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>stroke;
Horatia Seymour, number one; Eunice Ward, number two; and Norma
Southworth at the bow.</p>
<div class="figure p090width" id="p090"><img src="images/p090.png" alt=
"The &ldquo;Diana&rdquo; Course." width="238" height="264">
<p class="figureHead"><i>The &ldquo;Diana&rdquo; Course.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When the preliminary signal to make ready was given, both the crews
rowed gracefully to the starting ground and began to manoeuvre. At the
sharp report of the signal gun, the two shells shot past the line
almost abreast, amidst deafening acclamation from the spectators on the
shore and the shrill tooting and whistling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>of the
sailing craft of every description that had formed almost a compact
circle around the course.</p>
<p>The calm and pleasant weather had allowed the waters of the Hudson
to run as smooth as a looking-glass, except for the turbulence caused
by the ever restless pleasure boats thronged with sightseers, each
endeavoring to get a better vantage point of the impending struggle. As
the contest progressed, the interest of the watchers began to increase.
Thousands of field and marine glasses and lorgnettes were leveled at
the racers as they sped along the course.</p>
<p>The teams had now reached the point of divergence, and had begun to
recede from each other at every stroke on their parabolic circuit, the
boys turning to port and the girls to starboard. But alas! Hardly had
the Seminary shell advanced half a dozen strokes when, by some
unexpected and inexplicable accident, Margaret&rsquo;s feet slipped off
the foot guard and, in an instant, she was thrown into the waters of
the Hudson, the shell meanwhile gliding swiftly by.</p>
<p>Instantly the air was filled by a deafening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>cry of
dismay from the throats of thousands of eager spectators, coupled with
piercing whistles of the steamboats. What a moment of anguish for the
Diana Seminary girls! What a shocking sense of humiliation for the fair
contestants! To think that in an event so crucial for their honor and
standing, such an unforeseen disaster should overwhelm them!</p>
<div class="figure p092width"><img src="images/p092.jpg" alt=
"On the &ldquo;Homestretch&rdquo;" width="366" height="559">
<p class="figureHead">On the &ldquo;Homestretch&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But fate was with them. It was decreed that such a catastrophe
should happen in order to heighten the grandeur of their ultimate
victory. While the spectators were still paralyzed with the awful
situation before them, there was activity and heroism among the Diana
mermaids in the shell. The instant Aurora with her alert eyes saw
Margaret&rsquo;s mishap, she realized at once the situation and before
the shell had glided past, she leaned over and caught Margaret by the
hair. By the same impulsive and almost animal agility, Margaret grasped
Aurora&rsquo;s arm and in another moment, with less loss of time than
would seem possible, she was again in the shell. In a twinkling of an
eye the breathless girl had resumed her place at the oar as if nothing
had happened.</p>
<p>Aware of the loss of distance by this untoward <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>accident, which was, in fact, more than four
boats&rsquo; length, but undismayed and as if invigorated by her
impromptu bath, in order to recover lost ground Margaret set the pace
at a higher speed and forged ahead with might and main. When the
throngs on land and water realized what had happened the din of
exultation and cheering was beyond description and this did not abate
until the race was finished. Overwrought by the sight of this heroic
exploit of the girls, men and women had become madly hysterical. When
the shells crossed each other at the half-mile stake it was seen that
the Seminary girls had recovered considerable ground, leaving a margin
of less than two boats&rsquo; length. Encouraged by the splendid
showing made, and goaded to endeavor by the rapturous applause of the
populace, Margaret and the rest of the crew seemed to gain new
strength. And when Aurora with the megaphone gave the order of
thirty-six strokes a minute, they set the pace with marvelous vigor and
precision, causing consternation among their masculine antagonists.</p>
<p>On the completion of the second parabola of their circuit and when
coming on to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>line for the homestretch, it was noticeable that
the Seminary shell was only a trifle behind.</p>
<p>The crucial moment had come.</p>
<p>They were now almost abreast on the homestretch. The intensity of
the exciting scene had for a moment cast a profound silence upon the
spectators. Every one was straining his eyes and neck to see the
momentous finish, only to break again into a bedlam of rapturous
shouting when the girls were seen to be in the lead. It was indeed a
sight never to be forgotten, when the Seminary shell shot past the
finish line a full boat&rsquo;s length ahead, and the girls were
acclaimed by the populace as victors.</p>

"The Winning Crew" width="313" height="388">
<p class="figureHead">The Winning Crew</p>
</div>
<p>The intensity of the joy of the throng, and the plight of their
utter abandon, can be conjectured when it was discovered afterwards
that eight hundred and ninety-one ladies&rsquo; and two thousand three
hundred and seventy-nine gentlemen&rsquo;s head-gear were picked up in
the Hudson. The next day and through the week following, divers reaped
a good harvest by bringing up from the river&rsquo;s bed one thousand
three hundred and ninety-four field, marine and opera glasses, and two
hundred and seventy-five lorgnettes, besides innumerable parasols
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>and canes which the people in their abandon had
thrown about.</p>
<p>This episode was the crowning glory of the Seminary and the
beginning of a new epoch in the history of this institution.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Dr. Hyder Ben Raaba</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like a nebular comet in a far away constellation, so
mysterious in its orbit and composition, was Dr. Hyder Ben Raaba, who
suddenly made his appearance in the suburbs of the cosmopolitan city of
B&mdash;&mdash; on Long Island. He occupied the spacious mansion of a
wealthy merchant, who had abandoned it for a more comfortable lodge in
the Adirondacks. Surrounded by somewhat neglected clumps of pines and
shrubberies, the establishment was entirely isolated from the highway
and most suitable for a man like the Hindoo doctor, who seemed always
to desire seclusion.</p>
<p>In order to form an idea of his singular personality, a brief
description will perhaps enlighten the reader. He was tall, lank, of
swarthy complexion, endowed with a cyranesque proboscis and a moustache
which protruded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>like the tusks of a walrus. His eyebrows resembled
the moustache in miniature. His big greenish-yellow eyes, with spacious
white borders and cat-like pupils, were able to bring to bear an
intensely hypnotic gaze, which had an irresistible and subjective
power. As he was invariably attired in the picturesque costume of his
country, and from the fine texture of the silken turban and embroidered
robes, could easily be conjectured that he belonged to a high caste and
noble Hindoo family. He had a peculiar walk, continually swerving from
side to side as he moved, wriggling and swinging his indispensable
jessamine cane, which from its serpentine convolutions looked as if it
had been hardened while in convulsions.</p>
<p>The people of the neighborhood, although amused by his strange
antics, entertained great respect for him. To some, especially to young
people, he seemed a monstrosity. They had already nick-named him the
&ldquo;Crazy Doctor.&rdquo; Vague rumors circulated among the
gossip-loving residents that he was a political refugee, who, finding
his life in danger in India, had fled from his native land. But no one
doubted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>his ability as a physician and surgeon, for in a
short time he had founded a reputation that commanded respect.</p>
<p>His cadaverous look, his strange hypnotic eye and mysteriously
eccentric movements, enhanced a hundredfold his reputation rather than
damaged it. Every one considered him a man of great learning, a wizard
in the science of healing and stood aghast exclaiming wonderingly,
&ldquo;Whence cometh this mighty healing power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dr. Ben Raaba made his advent in B&mdash;&mdash; he was
accompanied by a robust, well-formed and intelligent-looking Levantine
Jew servant, Esau by name. This person minded his own business, and
proved himself to be a very discreet servant, never divulging his
master&rsquo;s secrets to any outsider. A few months after taking up
their residence, however, the place resembled a private menagerie.
Scores of cats, dogs, of high and low degree, pigs and goats of every
size made their appearance.</p>
<p>Dr. Hyder, notwithstanding various opinions of others, was in
reality a mysterious and remarkable man; despite his thorough British
education and extensive travels in foreign <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>lands,
was a believer in the tenets of a Hindoo sect called the Saktian Yogis,
a believer of Mahadeva, whose spouse of a dual nature&mdash;spiritual
and material principles in one&mdash;has three qualities: first,
Dominion and Desire; second, Rectitude and Wisdom, with power to
control senses; and third, Violence and Passion.</p>
<p>The Doctor, moreover, was conversant with all the Hindoo mysticism
and sciences, astronomy and magic. He was capable of restraining
respiration, besides being a natural born hypnotist of great power.
Modern practical medicine and surgery were also among the
Doctor&rsquo;s accomplishments, as he had a seven year course in the
National University of Medicine of London.</p>
<p>His appearances in public began to diminish gradually after the
various animals were received there, as he was engrossed in his
laboratory, engaged in some experiment in vivisection! Indeed, in the
dead of night, weird and uncanny sounds often emanated from the inner
recesses of his laboratory. Sometimes a piteous mew, or the piercing
caterwaul of felines, or the whining of dogs. At other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>times, the plaintive beating of a goat, the
squeaking of a goose or the squeal of a pig broke the silence of the
night, while at intervals, now and then, several owls on the roof gave
vent to their weird hootings.</p>
<div class="figure p100width"><img src="images/p100.jpg" alt=
"Hyder Ben Raaba and the Goat in the Garden" width="317" height="455">
<p class="figureHead">Hyder Ben Raaba and the Goat in the Garden</p>
</div>
<p>This state of affairs naturally gave an awful aspect to the place,
and kept the inquisitive villagers at a distance, while the mischievous
youngsters gave the place no trouble from trespassing. The only
incident which reached the public was told by a precocious youth who,
with grim determination, strived to unravel the mysteries of the place,
on a cloudy night had crawled into the garden, climbed a tree, and
hidden himself until later on, when the full moon appeared above the
horizon and cast its hazy light through the clouds. Then an uncanny
sight was unfurled before his eyes; there, sitting under the shadow of
a weeping willow tree, the Hindoo Doctor, apparently, was in the act of
hypnotizing a goat, with weird gestures and incantations. Unnerved by
this strange sight, the intruder, losing his grip and footing, fell to
the ground. The hooting of an owl and a fiendish howl from the Doctor
gave the youth a further impetus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101"
href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>to scamper for life, over
shrubberies and picket fence, out of the domain of the Hindoo
vampire!</p>
<p>Upon the youth&rsquo;s recital of his experience, the feeling of
mystery and fear increased among the unsophisticated people of the
neighborhood and they kept shy of the place. But the climax of their
apprehension was reached when, shortly after, the following curious
sign adorned the main gate to the house:</p>
<p class="boxed">DR. HYDER BEN RAABA<br>
VIVISECTIONIST AND RE-INCARNATOR</p>
<p>What was the meaning of these significant words on his shingle,
&ldquo;Vivisectionist and Re-incarnator?&rdquo; What was the mission of
this mysterious man? To what line of surgical science did this
assortment of animals contribute, whose piteous wails ever and anon
emanated from his laboratory? Up to that time a chain of wonderful
discoveries and marvelous achievements had been attained by profound
savants in surgical and pathological subjects: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>The
creation of life germ cells: The trepanning of skulls and the
re-arrangement of the brains: The grafting of skin, nose and ear: The
infusion of new blood: The pre-natal determination of sexes: The
separation of mind from the body, by subjecting persons in a cataleptic
state by hypnotism: And last but not least, the hibernation for an
indefinite period of living bodies by suspended animation.</p>
<p>These amazing triumphs, each more startling than the other, were the
records of past achievements.</p>
<p>Could there be anything more astounding?</p>
<p>Even so, Dr. Hyder Ben Raaba, who was <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1383" title="Source: conservant">conversant</span> with all the
above mentioned exploits of experimenters, had conceived one of the
boldest and extraordinarily audacious of surgical feats, the successful
demonstration of which would startle the world and make men stand
aghast with wonder. In fact, by the display of his professional sign,
it was a foregone conclusion that he had succeeded in his
experiments.</p>
<p>By the aid of science, occultism and wonderful magic, he had
transformed the sexes! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=

London, England. Margaret had accompanied her in an automobile to the
city of B&mdash;&mdash; to see her off. Their parting had an unusual
sadness as they stood on the deck of the Dynamoship
&ldquo;Columbia&rdquo;&mdash;a four-day ocean greyhound. They seemed to
be paralyzed at the barrenness of the future, looking into each
other&rsquo;s eyes as if trying to challenge sincerity to their oath of
allegiance.</p>
<p>It was extremely touching indeed, when they were compelled by the
officers of the ship to take their final leave, and as the Columbia
began to recede gradually from its moorings, her prow compassed to the
British Isles, Aurora&rsquo;s lithe figure could be seen at the stern
of the boat, throwing kisses and waving her handkerchief toward
Margaret, until the distance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>grew wider and farther and the
figure fainter and at last was lost to view.</p>
<p>Left alone on the shore, Margaret did her utmost to control her
emotions of parting from her beloved friend. With suppressed feelings
she mounted her automobile reluctantly, and bade the chauffeur proceed
to New York City, from whence, after a short repose, she intended to
take the train for her home in Wyoming.</p>
<p>She had hardly gone a mile or two out of the city of B&mdash;&mdash;
when her emotions had swelled beyond her capacity of control and she
became delirious in her seat in the auto. Some pedestrians by the way,
noticing that something unusual had happened to the fair occupant,
called the attention of the chauffeur to his charge. He brought the
machine to a standstill and the necessity of enlisting the services of
a doctor was at once apparent.</p>
<p>One of the bystanders suggested that the nearest available doctor
was <span class="corr" id="xd26e1406" title="Source: tho">the</span>
Hindoo surgeon, Dr. Hyder Ben Raaba, about a furlong farther down the
road, and thither the patient was wheeled with all possible haste, and
within a few minutes she was in the Doctor&rsquo;s reception room.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a cursory examination Ben Raaba appeared somewhat puzzled.
&ldquo;She is in a state of coma,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his forehead
with his bony fingers, &ldquo;but I do not yet see any physical cause
to induce that condition. It seems to me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that
every function of the organs are in a perfectly normal
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face brightened at once, however, with a smile of victory. A
happy thought had come to his fertile mind. He had thought of the
singular methods practised by the diagnostician Avicene of
Balk&mdash;the father of occult Diagnosis&mdash;and the words of the
Cashmerian poet came to his memory, who nearly ten centuries previously
had said: &ldquo;The pulse of the loving, beats higher, agitated only
at the name of the beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking thereupon her pulse into his hand, he began to question the
chauffeur, where she had gone, with whom, what was the other young
lady&rsquo;s name, etc. He knew that, although she was in a state of
coma, her senses of hearing and of understanding were performing their
regular functions. At the mention of the name of Aurora Cunningham
there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>was a remarkable change in Margaret; her pulse
began to beat double quick!</p>
<p>After repeating the experiment, and satisfying himself that the
cause was a matter pertaining the heart, in fact the girl&rsquo;s
infatuation for her departed friend, and that there was nothing in the
Materia Medica as an antidote, that the only restorative remedy that
could be found was in hypnotic occultism, he leaned over the prostrate
figure before him and whispered some words into her ear.</p>
<p>The correctness of his diagnosis became plainly evident. The
patient, with perfect tranquility, opened her eyes, and with a
complacent smile looked into the face of her restorer. After a few more
magnetic passes and words of encouragement from the Wizard, she had
completely recovered herself, to the amazement of the anxious group of
persons who had gathered there, curious to know the fate of the fair
occupant of the automobile. Within half an hour she again entered her
auto and proceeded on her way to the city.</p>
<p>The new and remarkable personality of Hyder Ben Raaba, however, left
an ineradicable impression upon her mind, so much as at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>times to divert her thoughts from dwelling upon
Aurora and concentrate upon the strange visage of Hyder Ben Raaba.
After a repose of a few days in New York, having made all the
preparations for the intended journey, she left the metropolis and
arrived in due time at her paternal home in Wyoming.</p>
<p>Hardly a month had elapsed after her return when there was another
crisis in her life. Her father was taken suddenly ill and died, and she
was left an heiress to a large fortune consisting principally of lands,
mines and cattle. Being without any relatives to guide her, Margaret
was compelled to settle matters for herself, and daily she was
confronted by hundreds of annoying details. These consisted of many
entangling affairs of her lamented father, who had left her sole
legatee, prospective aspirants who sought her hand in marriage, her
solemn and binding oath to Aurora, and, strange as it may seem, the
grotesquely hideous face of Ben Raaba began to flit before her
mind&rsquo;s eye, perplexing and haunting her incessantly.</p>
<p>One evening when she was thus absorbed in deep meditation, the
postman brought her a letter. It was mailed from B&mdash;&mdash;.
Excitedly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>she tore open the envelope and from it fell the
professional card of Dr. Hyder Ben Raaba. The same weird and ominous
words were printed under his name: &ldquo;The Vivisectionist and
Re-incarnator&rdquo;! On the other side were scribbled a few lines,
making inquiry about the state of her health.</p>
<p>The card, ah! the strange and significant words, vivisection and
re-incarnation began to assume a deep meaning. She placed the card
tremblingly upon the table and fell into a profound study. Her
quivering frame, the rise and fall of her heaving breast and the change
of color of her face alternatively from pallor to a feverish flush,
indicated that there was a revolution going on within her immaculate
bosom.</p>
<p>At last she seemed to come to some determination; tremblingly she
grasped a pen and wrote a letter to Ben Raaba, the contents of which
never became known to any but herself and the Hindoo doctor. Within a
fortnight she received an answer which seemed to satisfy her.</p>
<p>Within two months she had managed hastily to dispose of all her
personal property and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>real estate without any reserve,
and then she disappeared from her Western home and surroundings and was
lost forever to her former friends. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Transformation</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was near the end of September. The seaside resorts
on Long Island were deserted by the gay health-seekers from the
adjacent cities, and the inhabitants of the villages along the South
Shore, from Rockaway to Montauk, had dwindled to their normal number of
rural residents except the city of B&mdash;&mdash; which, on account of
its shipping interests, still retained a lively activity.</p>
<p>The day was dismal and damp, foreboding a rainy spell. There were
scarcely any people on the streets and at dusk, when the Montauk
express stopped at the station of B&mdash;&mdash;, there were only a
few passengers to alight.</p>
<p>One of them was a young woman attired in black, with a thick veil of
similar hue drawn over her face. She looked furtively up and down the
platform with painful anxiety, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>espying an automobile a few
rods below the station, walked toward it hesitatingly, at the same time
pulling from her wrist-bag a crimson handkerchief. The chauffeur on the
machine seemed to understand the meaning of the signal, for at once
jumping down he advanced to meet the stranger.</p>
<p>After several words were exchanged in subdued tones, he escorted the
veiled lady to the vehicle and in a few minutes they were speeding down
the road toward the Hindoo doctor&rsquo;s sanitarium. The woman, of
course, was Margaret MacDonald and the chauffeur none other than the
Levantine Jew, Esau, the Doctor&rsquo;s discreet servant. When they
arrived at Ben Raaba&rsquo;s domicile it was almost pitch dark, and not
a soul could be seen in the vicinity. At the ringing of the door-bell,
Ben Raaba himself appeared and sedately welcomed Margaret, conducting
her into the reception room.</p>
<p>Shortly after, when Esau had withdrawn, they were sitting
<i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1460" title=
"Source: tete-a-tete">t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</span></i> at a
table, perusing some mysterious documents to which at last, Margaret,
taking a pen, subscribed her signature.</p>
<p>The documents were nothing else than the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>legal contract, which Margaret had signed,
offering herself a willing subject to undergo a mental and physical
metamorphosis, and absolving Ben Raaba from any responsibility if the
experiment should prove unsuccessful or fatal!</p>
<p>After a fortnight of dietary preparation, Margaret was taken into
the Laboratory of the Wizard and immediately hypnotized by him into a
state of cataleptic coma.</p>
<div class="figure p112width"><img src="images/p112.jpg" alt=
"Ben Raaba&rsquo;s Laboratory" width="362" height="513">
<p class="figureHead">Ben Raaba&rsquo;s Laboratory</p>
</div>
<p>An awful sensation crept over one upon looking around about this den
called the Laboratory. Glittering saws and scalpels were hung in rows
on the walls; lances, beakers and retorts were scattered on the tables
and on the floor, and a hundred and one other apparatus and bottles
could be seen upon the shelves.</p>
<p>A big cat-owl perched on a pedestal in one corner, and a black
tom-cat with intense green eyes, prowling about the room, gave to the
scene a cabalistic and weird aspect. Here among these uncanny
surroundings Dr. Hyder Ben Raaba isolated and busied himself with
continuous vigilance for many months in order to achieve an undertaking
that seemed miraculous and impossible.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>Through the lapse of so many long and tedious months Dr. Hyder Ben
Raaba had come to the completion of his assiduous labors,&mdash;labors
which had almost exhausted his consummate skill in hypnotism, surgery
and magic.</p>
<p>After a final but scrupulously careful examination of the patient,
assuring himself that every muscle, nerve, gland and artery were in
their proper places, he paused a moment before the prostrate body. It
was a solemn and tragic moment. Signs of intense anxiety were visible
upon his otherwise imperturbable visage, betraying the fact that he was
in a crucial predicament.</p>
<p>What, if on awakening the patient, he found her a maniac irrevocably
bereft of reason? What, if his re-incarnated subject should prove to be
a hideous Frankenstein or a monstrosity devoid of finer senses? What,
if she should prove to be a man with effeminate mind and manners?</p>
<p>Such and a thousand other similar fears and misgivings were flashing
in that moment through his mind, but at last, confident of his ultimate
success, and undaunted with apprehensions, he assumed a determined
countenance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>and commenced to undo the hypnotic spell, in
order to restore his subject to life and energy.</p>
<p>With eyes dilated, eyebrows knit, and arms stretched&mdash;holding
in one hand a magic wand&mdash;this future Mephisto uttered some
mysterious words in sepulchral intonations, snapped his fingers three
times, and presto!</p>
<p>The spell was broken!</p>
<p>The full magical effect of his audacious undertaking was evident,
for scarcely had the last syllable of those mysterious and
incomprehensible words left his shriveled lips, when a sudden tremor
shook the frame of Margaret and, with a subdued groan, indicative more
of a sensation of bliss than of pain, she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>A triumphant smile pervaded her countenance, as if awakening from an
Utopian dream. Dr. Ben Raaba, meanwhile perceiving the crowning success
of his work, and standing beside her, began to exclaim with rapturous
joy, &ldquo;Metempsychosis! Metempsychosis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patient at once became conscious that her bodily transformation
was complete, for it did not take her long to realize it as HE stood
there, a beautiful specimen of manhood! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>This miraculous transformation brought to light another remarkable
mental discovery. It was discovered by the Doctor that all the
accomplishments, knowledge and mental attributes possessed by Margaret,
prior to her re-incarnation, had been intensified a hundredfold in
their entity into those of aggressive, daring and strenuous
masculinity.</p>
<p>Margaret, assuming forthwith a masculine name, remained a few months
under the care and tutelage of Ben Raaba, in order to acquire further
important knowledge in hypnotism, diplomacy, etc., that would be of
invaluable service in his future career, and it was not until
September, almost one year after the advent of the patient, that he
reluctantly bade good-bye to Hyder Ben Raaba, and was again lost in the
vortex of humanity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Lord Cunningham, Viceroy of India</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hardly had Margaret reached her home in Wyoming, when
Aurora likewise was welcomed by her people in England. Her father,
whose brilliant career upward from the ranks of the common people had
astonished the diplomats of the world, meanwhile had been raised to the
highest rank of peerage.</p>
<p>Being a born leader of such inexhaustible sagacity and acumen, his
promotion from one important position to another was not only
inevitable but necessary, and hardly a month had elapsed since
Aurora&rsquo;s return to London, before he was gazetted as Lord
Cunningham, Viceroy to India.</p>
<p>The situation at that time in India was quite a delicate one, on
account of the Thibetan boundary question with Russia. The latter had
raised her periodical spasm of aggression, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>order to attain certain political ends at home,
and the departure of Lord Cunningham was therefore hastened.</p>
<p>It was near the end of November when Lord Cunningham, his wife and
beautiful daughter were regally received in Bombay. Distinguished
looking in his six feet two inches of height, with a leonine
countenance, The Lord at once captivated the Indian rajahs, princes,
and also commanded the respect of the populace. His courteous manners,
forceful and firm proclamations and actual philanthropic undertakings
coupled with his propaganda of dispensing equal justice to all, aroused
at once the enthusiasm, patriotism and loyalty of every class, and
quieted the racial differences and political disquietude among the
people.</p>
<p>The Russian government, seeing this solid phalanx of unity and
change of sentiment of the Indian people, beat a hasty retreat under
the subterfuge of quelling an alleged disturbance on the borders of
Manchuria.</p>
<p>In order to give himself an opportunity for a general introduction,
Lord Cunningham decided to hold a reception and dance. It was planned
to follow the style of entertaining then <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>in vogue, a
combination of literary and musical talent to be followed by a
reception. Among the many who had consented to contribute to the
evening&rsquo;s entertainment, and occupying the place of honor, was
the celebrated savant Abou Shimshek, the Astronomer of Ispahan, who had
just returned from an adventurous expedition to the Himalayas to
investigate Nature&rsquo;s wonders.</p>
<p>Lord Cunningham being aware of the presence of the celebrated
prodigies, the Dusky Quartette, who were on their itinerary to Bombay,
had sought and engaged their services for the occasion. An American
violin virtuoso, Spencer Hamilton, who had created a furore in Simla a
week previously at a fashionable society recital and was acclaimed as
an unequaled maestro of his instrument, had also promised to appear
during the entertainment and render a few selections on the violin.</p>
<p>On the night of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1534" title=
"Source: Soiree">Soir&eacute;e</span> a great multitude of natives as
well as eminent European personages were present, in all the
picturesque splendor of the habilaments of their respective countries.
There were Maharajahs, dazzling with diamonds, accompanied by their
retinue blazing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span>with silver and gold embroidered costumes,
Ascetic Brahmins and sombre looking Fakirs from the seats of learning
of Hyderabad, mysterious emissaries from the sacred city of Delhi,
learned Sheiks with flowing patriarchal beards from Arabia and Egypt,
Magicians from all over Persia, besides all fashionable folk from
military posts throughout the East Indian Empire.</p>
<p>Dashing and handsome officers vied with each other in their endeavor
to do homage to the beautiful Aurora, who was enthroned next to her
mother. After a prelude on the dulciphone, Abou Shimshek, amidst the
huzzah and clamor of the assemblage, with great dignity came forward,
and with uplifted arms, invoking the spirits of Hafiz and Firdozy to
endow him with eloquence, began the account of his thrilling adventure
as follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Up, on the Kinchinginga&rsquo;s lofty summit,
where earth and heavens meet, where myriads of crystalline, icy temples
in their immaculate and prismatic garbs here and there, and manywhere
abound, temples, in whose solid glacial niches saints perpetually hold
communion with Mahatma&rsquo;s Son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, I was upon the Kinchinginga&rsquo;s. Aye, for no
other purpose than on a mission sublime, to climb nearer to heaven in
search of the Creator&rsquo;s secrets profound and reveal them to the
human race. Day after day, thus, dauntless and resolute, I scaled
craggy precipices. Through mammoth caverns of desolate solitude I
wended my way up to reach the goal of my ambition, lured there by my
faith.</p>
<div class="figure p120width"><img src="images/p120.jpg" alt=
"Abou Shimshek in the Cave" width="337" height="383">
<p class="figureHead">Abou Shimshek in the Cave</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Night after night, thus, I gazed and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>scanned heaven&rsquo;s canopy, studded with
twinkling jewels. But alas! it seemed, farther and more remote grew the
space between me and the blue heaven, with no mortal kind to cheer my
solitude, except the wails of hungry jackals and the wild groans of the
Bengal tiger fierce, with myriads of phantom spirits, darting here and
there, in weird, fantastic forms; I could not tell whether they were
the creatures of some world unseen, or the ghosts of Gothama and his
saints keeping vigil over the faithful. But at last, so dire and awful
did grow my solitude that, overcome by fright and fatigue, I retreated
into a glacial cave beneath a lofty peak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laid my head on a chilled stalagmite, the frozen floor to
my back, and my face and belly against what I thought to be the dome of
my cavern. But, by the sacred wart that grew on Gehangire&rsquo;s nose,
what reality! What a wonderful sight! A new world, revolving through
space&mdash;entirely different from ours as it had living souls and
vegetation in a far more advanced stage of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1563" title="Source: develoment">development</span> than
ours,&mdash;was revealed to my astonished eyes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest efforts of men are brought to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>naught with the elements controlled by
Allah&rsquo;s command, or are so small in scale and scope as to be
beyond compare with His wondrous works. Through the greatest telescope
that man&rsquo;s ingenuity and skill can produce, astronomers cannot
agree whether the canals of Mars are single or double.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Away with those numberless imposters who have deluded
mankind with their consummate lies! Some even claim to have traversed
the inter-etherial space by flying machines, whose construction was
revealed to them in a &ldquo;sealed package&rdquo; or found in boxes,
buried in tombs and mummies of days gone by! The marvelous medium
through which I saw this celestial panorama was nothing strange; the
cavern into which I so unconsciously was led was an observatory by
nature made!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its dome was a mammoth telescope, composed of lenses of great
magnitude, various in size and shape. Lenses made of purest water,
distilled by the thundering clouds and filtered through heaven&rsquo;s
ether. Lenses congealed by the zephyrs that gently blow from Mount
Everest&rsquo;s snow-capped brow; lenses, annealed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>and
polished through centuries by the fiery orb that governs our earth,
from its moorings in wondrous space. Here, to my eye, was a telescope
most complete. It brought that strange planet so near as to make me
inhale its very atmosphere, touch its soil and waters with my
outstretched arms. And which, with your kind tolerance, I will briefly
relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first element on this marvelous world, which my attention
did attract, was the wonderful hues of its firmament. There were no
&ldquo;inter-luminous rays&rdquo; of &ldquo;rosy radiance&rdquo; nor
&ldquo;amber isles&rdquo; floating over &ldquo;golden seas&rdquo; of
sunsets, or similar trash, that our poets here below have sung for ages
gone, over and over again. But instead, wonderfully colored panels of
exquisite designs, the whole changing as if by a dissolving slide, at
every atmospheric vibration, into still more beautiful patterns, a
veritable Kaleidoscope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;On consulting my astronomical calculations I found that this
strange phenomenon was caused by the peculiar inclination, and
ascension of this planet toward the sun! As I was scanning this sublime
panorama, with rapturous admiration, my attention was diverted to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>an expanse of water. Its constantly foaming and
sparkling nature induced me to examine it more closely and, to my great
surprise, upon analysis I found it to be similar to delicious cream
soda, with cakes of ice floating on it, and the whole impregnated with
phosphates&mdash;on account of the immense guano deposits left by
extinct birds, along its shores!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my surprise was still increased when, turning my eyes
toward land, I beheld numerous geysers and fountains, spouting up
streams and sprays of waters of various hues. I tasted them one by one
and, to my delight, I found some of them to be composed of
seltzero-caffein, some of bromo-cocain, some others containing an
infusion of Cerebrine. But one of the most peculiar fountains which I
discovered was one that had a zig-zag motion and luminous color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On partaking of a sip of it, I suddenly experienced a strange
sensation going through my body, exhilarating and rejuvenating my whole
system, eradicating all the dandruff from my scalp, purifying my blood
and dispelling at once that &ldquo;tired feeling.&rdquo; I gave to this
fountain the name &ldquo;Electrolinaris&rdquo; on account <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>of
the large percentage of &ldquo;the electric fluid&rdquo; it
contained!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vegetation that grew on this marvelous planet, although
analogous to our terrestrial trees and herbs&mdash;having roots, trunks
and branches&mdash;was entirely of different order. These forms were a
combination of vegetable and animal kingdoms, because of their
construction and sensitiveness. I noticed, for example, trees whose
leaves changed color several times a day, some others which emitted
extraordinary sounds, while still others shrank and expanded
instantaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But their fruits were still more curious. Of course to
satisfy my natural curiosity, I picked and tasted many of them. They
were nothing but our manufactured confections. Still how delicious they
were! Here was a tree the folds of whose musical leaves shielded
delicious chocolates, there another tree whose branches dropped ripe
and luscious glace bon-bons of various flavors, while sugar-coated
violets and jasmines abounded promiscuously on perfuming bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During my inspection I came across a palm-like plant full of
innumerable shining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>objects which, on closer scrutiny, to my
amazement I found to be miniature incandescent radium lights of great
brilliancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I proceeded with my investigations I saw another plant
whose branches were studded with brilliant scintillating globules. I
hastened to examine them and they were neither more nor less than
veritable crystals of diamonds. Now it is well known that the diamond
consists of pure carbon in crystalized form. This plant had simply the
power of absorbing pure carbon by its roots, and passing through its
wonderfully peculiar fibres exuded and condensed them on its branches
like gum-drops, where they were hardened by the action of its equally
strange atmosphere. I have on my person&mdash;as you will
observe&mdash;a few specimens which I picked at random.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now in reference to animals. Perhaps you will expect me
to describe to you strange megalotheruses of immense proportions, or
gigantic mammalian quadrupeds, mammoth flying dragons, serpents and
birds, but herein I must disappoint you. The truth is, although I
searched diligently for such paleozoic monsters, I came in contact with
none. Surprised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"
name="pb127">127</a>]</span>as I was myself, it explained itself on my
discovering an <span class="corr" id="xd26e1603" title=
"Source: ampitheatre-like">amphitheatre-like</span> enclosure wherein
were stored, in great numbers, the lifeless skeletons of unimaginable
beasts which had existed on this planet in centuries past. And as on
our earth the large animals are gradually becoming extinct on account
of the advance of civilization, with the exception of the Tammany
Tiger, the American Eagle and the British Lion, I came to the
conclusion that on this new sphere likewise, because of its far
advanced stage of civilization, they were already extinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not, however, suppress my laughter on seeing in this
collection of monstrous wild beasts, two specimens of two-legged
mammalians or human beings. I speedily came to the conclusion that they
were either some of those blatant fools, who had ventured on journeys
to remote planets in their flying machines, or some of our
ultra-civilized English and American pioneers, gone on missions of
&ldquo;grab&rdquo; and &ldquo;benevolent assimilation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anon, I come to the most interesting stage of my adventure,
that of seeing the most intelligent animals of this new planet, which
it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>seemed had full control over it, so that there
remained no doubt in my mind of their being the human race of this
strange world. Consequently, I watched them closely, and verily I found
them to be far more advanced in civilization and bodily construction
than we, mankind. They were so constructed that they had all the
advantages which we are obliged to supply ourselves by artificial means
and devices. As I describe them, you will, to a certain degree, form an
idea of how they looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had only one eye on the top of their heads, a large
globular organ, however, having like the dragon fly a multiform lens.
This eye was shielded by an umbrella-shaped substance of a hard bony
nature. Thus protected they could see all round about them at the same
time, or whichever side they wanted, without inconveniencing themselves
by craning their necks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would have been a great blessing if we mortals
here possessed such optics. Think of the advantage while going about in
a crowded thoroughfare of a great city, to see where you are stepping,
to read the various newspaper bulletins, to watch the clock on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>spire, to recognize your friends in the surging
throng and besides all these to be able to dodge adroitly the numerous
trolley cars and automobiles at the same time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In place of the eyes, there were two large circles, covered
by a delicate membrane of great sensitiveness, which instead of sight
was used for speech, because they did not speak with their mouths and
in audible sounds, but with these two curious circles they carried on a
conversation in &ldquo;silent eloquence,&rdquo; instantaneously
transmitting their thoughts to each other, a veritable telepathic
medium, as it were!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their noses and mouths were likewise equally strange and
entirely different from ours in construction, although to all
appearances they had the same form and occupied <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1623" title="Source: similiar">similar</span> places. For
instance, they could extend their nostrils at pleasure, shut air-tight
or open at will, so that at the mere suspicion of a bad odor they could
instantly elongate their proboscis to some point at which pure air and
perfume abounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mouth was so constructed that they could expand and
contract it like a chameleon&rsquo;s, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>but about three or
four yards, and in such inconceivable velocity that its rapidity of
action was beyond calculation. Its usefulness was manifold, because
they not only took nutrition by it, but it was also a very formidable
weapon of attack and defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wore absolutely no clothing, consequently were annoyed
by no tailor-made suits, no bloomers, no furbelows, but nature itself
had provided with all that was desirable. Their skins were covered from
the neck to the shoulder with white swansdown, and from the shoulders
to the waist with a fine silky fur, resembling in color and texture the
best quality of seal-skins, while from the waist sprouted all around
the loveliest crop of hanging ostrich feathers. There was no difference
in male and female attire. As women nowadays are speaking of equal
rights, and are adopting masculine tendencies, I believe we are on the
right line of advancement to reach the same destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their manner of locomotion was another surprise to me as I
watched them darting deftly here and there. Upon examination of their
lower extremities, I found it to be simply locomotion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>by
electricity. Under their feet were several wheels of natural formation
and whichever direction they wanted to go, they set the locomotive
current to any degree of celerity. Think of it! Each person having his
own automatic rapid transit!</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I became intensely interested in those strange beings, I
felt curious to know and study their social manners and discover
whether they experienced any emotions, sorrows or mirth. Consequently I
changed my observations to these particulars. In searching through the
gardens and flowery bowers that abounded in a certain locality, it was
not necessary for me to wait very long. My eyes rested upon a comical
spectacle, which left no doubt in my mind that it was a case of amorous
depredation. It was simply, as I judged, an act of stealing kisses. Oh,
the rascal! Here was a maiden sweet and fair, overcome perhaps by
fatigue, lying on the velvety grass of cobalt blue, her head resting on
a natural eiderdown-topped toadstool, and there, a precocious youth,
perched on a branch of a tree above, his elastic mouth in close contact
to that of the maiden, busily gathering, like the hummingbird, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>nectars of osculatory bliss, while his globular
eye kept watch round about for any unceremonious or hostile
intruder!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In vain I tried to imitate. Ah! I still feel the thrill. In
fact, I would not object to have a mouth so formed, even in this vain
world of ours. I believe there are flowers here also, ever in bloom,
like the fairy maiden above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reference to the pleasures and enjoyments of these
marvelous beings, I was somewhat nonplussed to find that there were no
theatres or places of amusement. The fact was that in every respect
they were very, very practical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they wanted to laugh, they simply went to certain
valleys in their locality where, on inhaling its atmosphere, they
became almost hysterical in their ecstasy of joy, giggling, ha-haing
and continuing in such hilarious laughter without stop until they were
thoroughly satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I became curious to know the nature of this atmospheric
element which produced such merriment, and on careful analysis found
the air to be strongly impregnated with pure nitrous oxide or
&ldquo;laughing gas,&rdquo; an inferior <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>quality of which was
formerly used by our dentists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise, when they felt a desire to cry, they went to
another neighborhood, where certain bushes abounded, bearing on their
drooping branches a profusion of &ldquo;Job&rsquo;s Tears,&rdquo; the
sight of which so affected the visitors that they were at once
transformed into veritable Niobes&mdash;all tears. They wept, sighed
and wailed until their longing had subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their solution of the habitation problem was, I think, that
which wise men on this earth have been trying to solve from the
beginning of creation. This Utopian planet contained no dwellings built
by mankind, consequently there were no taxes, no new land theories, no
internal revenue or protection embargoes. The planet itself produced
everything without the aid of its people and they enjoyed the fruit of
the soil equally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever these creatures desired to rest, they retired to
certain localities, where millions of velvety couches grew like
toadstools, on which they reclined, while the vegetation around, with
its narcotic perfumes, lulled them quietly to sleep. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The duration of their day, which was a continual twilight of
variegated designs, was according to my chronometer fifty hours long,
and they divided it into two equal parts, twenty-five hours of which
they slept in balmy dreamlands, while the other twenty-five they
indulged in all kinds of recreations and no work at all! Ah! as the
working hours of our laboring classes are decreasing day by day by the
glorious medium of Unionism, I am happy to predict that we are on the
right path of some day reaching that <span class="corr" id="xd26e1660"
title="Source: millenium">millennium</span> of doing nothing, so that
we shall at last have twelve hours of sleep, and twelve hours of
recreation!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw all these wonderful things, I confess, I forgot my
mission sublime, and determined then and there to transport myself to
that celestial sphere. Consequently I approached one of them and
appealed for admission to that land of rest and perpetual bliss.
Scarcely had I spoken, when I felt the atmosphere about me become
suffocating; there was thunder and lightning and a sepulchral voice was
heard to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e1667" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>No earthly domination here.<span class=

insensible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=

at the foot of the Kinchinginga&rsquo;s, amidst the ruins of that
wonderful telescope by nature made!&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thunderous applause of appreciation greeted Abou
Shimshek, at the conclusion of his interesting recital, and bowing
right and left his acknowledgements, with beaming countenance he
retired to his seat</p>
<p>An intermezzo of mellifluent music in the interim was followed by
the celebrated &ldquo;Dusky Quartette.&rdquo; This aggregation
consisted of the following members: Madam Celeste D&rsquo;oumbalooloo,
a south African soprano of heavenly sweetness, and a beauty of
&ldquo;hippopotamic gracefulness;&rdquo; Miss Guza Mulomba, the Kaffir
prodigy, with a contralto voice of tremulous colorature; Signor
Bombasto Reales, of Kabaloogan, a <span class="corr" id="xd26e1689"

<p>Indeed, under the felicitous protection of British and American
sovereignty, these colonies had made such rapid advancement toward
civilization, that they had produced an abundance of men and women of
extraordinary talent and capacity in art and music, so as to eclipse
their confreres of Hungarian and Polish origin, in days gone by.</p>
<p>The portfolio of their operatic creations was a revelation.
Especially did an <span class="corr" id="xd26e1702" title=
"Source: operatta">operetta</span>, called &ldquo;Phantasie
Senegambienne&rdquo; arouse the enthusiasm of the audience to such a
high pitch of spirituelle tension that at the
conclusion&mdash;regardless of the (color line)&mdash;there was a
simultaneous rush of both sexes to where the singers stood. A scene of
indescribable osculatory battle raged, the sound of the contact of
those luscious thick lips of the Dusky Quartette echoing and
reverberating to the utmost recesses of the spacious hall. It took
quite a long time before this charming labial fusillade of musical
appreciation subsided.</p>
<p>After another soothing interlude, giving the assemblage a chance to
recover their composure, a clamorous applause brought forth the
American violinist, to make his first debut in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>Bombay. As he stepped forward, Spencer Hamilton
instantly made a deep impression upon the audience. His masterful
technique and wonderful skill of execution, when he rendered a new
composition of his own, called &ldquo;The Niagara,&rdquo; aroused anew
the enthusiasm of the throng and, under pressure of vociferous
acclamation, he was obliged to render another selection.</p>
<p>With the appearance of this splendid young specimen of manhood upon
the platform there was created in the bosom of Aurora a strange
psychological condition. Although surrounded with many gallant officers
and youths of noble lineage, she was perceptibly affected by the sight
of this handsome young American musician. At a glance at the violinist
there sprang in her heart afresh the memories of her college days in
America.</p>
<p>A sudden sense of sadness swept over her, and her infatuation for
her chum Margaret, and the recollection of their solemn vows, flashed
vividly through her perplexed brain, evoking several deep sighs from
the depths of her constant heart. Notwithstanding the cringing advances
of many officers of position <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>and wealth, as well as scions of
nobles, she had fallen desperately in love with the stranger at first
sight. He seemed to her as an ideal, her affinity, but alas! she
remembered her vow! Aurora was in a very disturbed frame of mind when
Spencer Hamilton came forward for the encore.</p>
<p>Spencer Hamilton, the violin virtuoso had, in the meantime, another
mission to perform in connection with his appearance as a musical
artist. He was no other than Margaret MacDonald herself, metamorphosed
by Hyder Ben Raaba into the virile, manly fellow who had assumed the
name of Spencer Hamilton and, as a violinist, had come to lay siege to
the heart of Aurora.</p>
<p>With his furtive glances now and then he was reading the soul of
Aurora, now full of perplexing emotions. He could hardly control his
own emotions and began to render as an encore a tune which he expected
would create a tumult in the breast of Aurora Cunningham.</p>
<p>Putting forth all his energy so as to make it his best effort in
execution, he played to one alone.</p>
<p>At first Aurora thought that the tune had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>some
vague resemblance to a musical production which she had heard before,
but could not tell when and where. As it proceeded it gradually dawned
upon her that, somehow there was a connection between the thought of
Margaret and the music. She became more and more agitated and was quite
certain now that this soul-stirring melody was the creation of her
dear, beloved friend and confidant, Margaret MacDonald. Then she
realized that the words were her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the oath!&rdquo; she gasped, her brain in a delirium of
intoxication. Realizing fully that the melody was nothing else than the
very composition of Margaret, and that she had written the words at the
Diana Seminary on the very eventful night of the moonlight reception,
she was unable to conceive how it had become a public property. Was
Margaret after all a capricious traitor, a recalcitrant, who had
forsaken her solemn vow and desecrated their covenant?</p>
<p>These and other thoughts drove Aurora to the verge of collapse, and
as Spencer Hamilton concluded the piece with a finale of deep pathos
that reached the pinnacle of tragic intensity, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>there was commotion around where Aurora was
enthroned, for she had lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Thinking that the intense interest and excitement of the occasion
had caused her faintness, she was gently removed to her apartment and
the program of the evening&rsquo;s festivities was completed with a
brilliant reception and dance. Hamilton himself, however, was so
affected that he left the reception at once and returned to his hotel
and there tried to regain strength for the ordeal that he was planning
to carry out next day.</p>
<p>The following morning, at the proper time for calling in India, he
left his hostelry and directed his steps toward the Viceregal palace on
the pretense of making inquiry concerning the health of Aurora, but
ostensibly to reveal the mysterious metempsychosis of himself and to
reassert his undying love for her.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the gate he learned that Aurora had been restored
to her normal state of health and spirits. He consequently sent in his
card and a few minutes later was summoned to the drawing-room of the
palace where, after a second&rsquo;s waiting, Aurora Cunningham
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>appeared on the threshold, somewhat flushed and
agitated.</p>
<p>Hamilton, on seeing Aurora, came forward and, extending his hand,
inquired most anxiously for her health, and intimated that it would
give him extreme pleasure to explain certain circumstances which would
lead to the gratification of her own unspoken desires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the encore at last
night&rsquo;s musicale affected you very powerfully. I could
intuitively read from your perturbed countenance that you had become
aware of the authorship of the same. Aurora, Aurora, I am Margaret
MacDonald! I am your confidant at the Diana Seminary, whom you loved,
and am now metamorphosed into a man by the miraculous powers of the
vivisectionist and re-incarnator&mdash;Hyder Ben Raaba. I have come to
claim you as my own. Aurora, I love you!&rdquo;</p>

width="562" height="362">
<p class="figureHead">&ldquo;And With a Piercing Shriek, She Fell Into

</div>
<p>Aurora, bewildered at this remarkable and dramatic declaration and
revelation, too spellbound to speak even a word, uttered a piercing
shriek and fell into the open arms of Spencer Hamilton. At the sound of
this cry of distress, which echoed throughout the palace, footsteps
were heard approaching from every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>direction. Soldiers,
foot-guards, servants, and the Viceroy Cunningham himself with his
guests, rushed into the drawing-room and beheld this highly surprising
tableau of romantic love.</p>
<p>Explanations of very delicate and discreet nature were promptly
given to the Viceroy by the two lovers, and consent to their union was
presently forthcoming.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After a triumphal bridal tour through England and
America, Aurora and Spencer Hamilton settled in the Central African
Commonwealth, and by the strenuous qualities inherent in both they had
become popular and prominent in civic affairs. Fifteen years later, in
1976, through sheer merit of a public life of usefulness and rectitude,
Hamilton was gazetted as Viceroy to the African Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The year 1976 was indeed an epoch-making period. It was the two
hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and at the
same time the semi-centennial of the happy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>Anglo-American Alliance. The double jubilee of
these two nations, comprising nearly one-half of the world&rsquo;s
population, was celebrated wherever the English tongue was spoken, with
commensurate grandeur, enthusiasm and eclat, such as absolutely to
eclipse all the Durbars, <span class="corr" id="xd26e1765" title=

of the world.</p>
<p>And none the less, the composite but flourishing African
Commonwealth, under the wise regime of Spencer Hamilton, was ablaze
with prosperous pride in unison with England and America, for this
grand and felicitous dual occasion.</p>
